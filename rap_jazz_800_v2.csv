I Didn't Mean To,Casual,Rap,"Verse One:

All right I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin' on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her 'cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
'Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin' about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should have done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin' hold grudges well oh fudge
It's a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin' shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin' to front on me ya know
That's exactly how I'm goin' to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
'Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin' me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin'
Actin' like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and that's weak shit
That's why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to"

We have the one and only, Snoop D-O double G

Big Snoop Dogg
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that
I came up hard as hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening
That's about the time I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same

It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg bite 'em all, yeah I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
So get real fool, fool

(Snoop Dogg)
Local boy made good over night shit
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see
I paid the price, with consecutive platinum hits
I up my status, ain't no more Calvin Broadus
World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up

(Snoop Dogg)
You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, 'cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my yellow C's at night nigga"
Seaweed,Saul Williams,Rap,"I drive a yellow Volvo
'86, submarine
Someone's behind me in an escalade
Trying to blind me with their high beams

I make a left
I'm on the road to nowhere, heading west
The sky is purple streaks
The sun is setting in my chest

I feel warm inside
So I'm going for a ride
Put your picture on my dashboard
Till my fate and yours collides

Seaweed
Washed upon the shore
Severed locks of he who walks
The ocean's floor

Got a yellow Volvo
'86, submarine
Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels
And my tank is filled with dreams

Fuck the game
I practice being in the passing lane
And watch the price of gasoline
Rise with the price of fame

I'm immortal
I render unto Caesar to be cordial
He sees a wooden casket
Where I see a glowing portal

Check your engine
Looks like you're running on the blood of Indians
Put some turquoise in that Rolls Royce
Till you crash into a pendulum

Seaweed
Washed upon the shore
Severed locks of he who walks
The ocean's floor

Got a yellow Volvo
'86, submarine
I drove it under water
Guided by my own high beams

Nothing's left
Witnessed the demolition of the west
Feel like a little kid
Hiding in my mothers' dress

I'm in space
The lone ambassador of every race
The starfish that discover me
Plant their flags into my face

I'm a clone
Of every written and unwritten poem
A shark pulls up beside me
Fingering beads and chanting om

I can't believe it
I never really thought that sharks would need it
I thought they'd make their peace
Bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it

But I was wrong
Every living being deserves a song
And our passions must be rationed
Till our rations sing along"
(Bloody Paw On The) Kill Floor,Busdriver,Rap,"Buy now, I kill for a living
Buy now, I kill for a living...

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
To sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number
Buy now
You pasty Brits
Buy now
You crazy chicks
Buy
'Cause I don't pay attention to rules,
Regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
'Cause we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
'Cause I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Go To Hell,Prozak,Rap,"If it's hate that you speak

And if you cannot make amends
(Go to hell!)
And if you follow every trend
(Go to hell!)
And if you back stab your friends
(Go to hell!)
If you ain't down till the end
(Go to hell!)

The chosen one, the wicked son, they call Hitchcock
Talk some shit and I'ma hit you with this quick block
Body parts are scattered and sealed up in ziplocks
With my steel cats get ill'd up to six blocks
You can try to run away but you won't get far
They call me Prozak, BITCH!, the knight of Templar
I'll open up your brain like the Deathstar
And lyrics come to me like ghosts from the graveyard

Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead
Homocidal thoughts while I was bein' breast fed
I tried to kill myself but I survived instead
From pieces of a broken mirror, sliced my wrists, bled

Shit, my wicked rhymes will have you overdose
I'll leave your ass comatose
You try to play me close I'll levitate the smoke
When I hit the fuckin' stage be like, ""What's that smell?""
Sulfer and brimstone BITCH, go to hell

If it's hate that you speak

And if you pray upon the weak

And if you back stab your friends

If you ain't down till the end

They call me Hitchcock
The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs
Go to the station lock and load up on they whole staff
And let them know the danger of us crossin' paths
And let it be known that I spit the truth like a polygraph
So jot it down homie, copy that
There's always room for another carbon copycat
They tried to run with my style but I got it back
It's hard to sound just like me with your head in half
(Go to hell!)

If it's hate that you speak
(Go to hell!)
And if you pray upon the weak

Spreadin' lies and deceits

Let 'em all know that my moms is gone
And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home
Ding-dong it's on, nigga say no more
I'm with a truck full of women so just open the door
'Cause yo, we came here to party
Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody
True that, so homies don't bring your main misses
'Cause it's real deal mackin' when it comes to the Chris's
And this could be your very last time seein' her
One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her
So come alone or don't come at all (why?)

She say she listens to my music, but she can't get into it
She don't like it regular speed, she like it when they screw it
What I'm fin to do is, call Ron and Watts on my phone
Tell 'em slow it down, so the ladies can get they grind on
Yellow red or brown tone, call me when your guy's gone
If you gotta shake that lick, them haters get they diet on
She's the type rich men, will give money for some action
Said she's light skinned and, and she'll strip for Andrew Jacksons
Gets excited when, she be jamming them F Actions
Turn the lights off then, and if you wanna get your grind on
Just go pick up that phone, then just get your dial on
Call me up I'll come over, and help you turn your smile on

She's calling me, on my phone
Telling me she's feeling freaky, her body's in need of me
Hopping in on my 4's, grabbing my
Chopped and screwed c.d., and my grey T-A-P-E
Y'all know, playas get chose
Color Changin' Click c.d., Michael Watts, OG Ron C
Even your neighbors knew, just what I came to do
They seen the navy blue, choking on things of two
They know it ain't your boo, they heard us banging Screw
Making the headboard bang, while I'm banging you
Giving you a work out, like a trainer
Hit it then I flip you over, to change the view
My sex is a weapon, that's aimed at you
Finish and reload, just like a gangbanger do
You little angel you, that's what your friends think
'Cause they didn't see you, sipping on that red drink
Getting drunk, while I hit it on the sink
In the kitchen and I'm switching, I can hit it till the bed sink
You can lock the lock, I'm fin to rock the twat
I'm fin to give your friends, something new to talk about
Fin to give it to you shorty, you gon feel it in your body
Everytime Ron and Michael Watts, chop a spot
I ain't forgot about, the true DJ Screw
'Cause if it wasn't for Screw, wouldn't be nothing to do
No claiming red, no claiming blue
It wouldn't be nothing to bang, while I'm banging you, jeah

She said Koopa, I know you be checking these niggaz
But can the ladies get a lil' love, yeah

(Chamillionaire)
I don't discriminate the race, pretty face pretty shape
Shaped like figure eight, she can get a little steak
We can end a date, like a episode of Ricki Lake
Call a couple of your friends, they could participate
Get on my three way, now what is the delay
I pull out the video cam, and show you the replay
I screw you real slow, like a H-Town DJ

Girl I got you wet, girl I'll kiss your neck

Nigga Terry what's goin' on nigga
Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)
Yeah, haha

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
'Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin' it like us
C'mon what y'all want?

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
'Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin' to whoever wanna be ridin' my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin' like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
'Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
'Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin' this freakin

The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
Around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin' another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters
But I don't do it 'cause I need it, I do it 'cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it 'cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more

The killer fled with a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin' up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
Their I stood stiffer than wood it's the homie that use to buy me candy
Now he's gone who's gonna provide his family
My air bring this shit up 'n' runnin' I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn I wasn't suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought, it was more than 3 shots
It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around and my pops, he like 'what happened?'
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin', I can still hear him laughin'

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

(Verse 2: Lloyd Banks)

It was a regular day in southside, sprinklers 'n' kids runnin'
And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin' no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

(Verse 3: Lloyd Banks)

Now all my days go by blowin' that sicky icky
California made me picky
Chickenheads tryin' to stick me with a hicky
If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy
The location don't matter I'm southside until they hit me
I'd be dead
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills
For the kids who ain't got nothing and who got to steal, and from my
Cousin I lost, lookd over the steerin wheel

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body"
Money Make The World Go Around,G-Unit,Rap,"Tony Yayo:
Money make the world go round [x3]
New York, money make the world go round
L.A., money make the world go round
Midwest, money make the world go round
Down South, money make the world go round
Southside, money make the world go round

Some people want nothin' out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin' life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin' to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah a nigga rich but I'm livin' like a rebel
Ridin' with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin alive was no jive
Standin on the strip you get stuck like velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

(Chorus: Tony Yayo)
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours

Lloyd Banks:
Yeah, money make the world go round and I got her
Buckle down, do anything for the dollar
Enough bills'll make your blood spill
Kill for bread, anyone will from Queens to Gun Hill
I'm one man, but I own more than one steel
Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Magucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby
And if I'm wearin my chain it's 380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S
Have it how you want, speed knot or pop chess
Police stompin niggaz by the twenty
And shootin by the fifty, ain't a damn thing funny
Matter fact, man I'm a do anything for the dough
N.Y.'s finest with llamas and mo'

Tony Yayo:
A-T-L, money make the world go round
Ca$hville, money make the world go round
N.C., money make the world go round
Bad News, money make the world go round

I love that money, I need that money
It gives me shelter, it's there when I'm hungry
It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me, seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things
You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggaz goners, you rule all the corners
When somebody dies, you gotta pay the moroners, moroners

Girls (Limp Bizkit Diss)

Ayo dog
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that
I need to get off 'cause
If I don't
I'ma fucking explode or somethin'
Now look
This is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickenin
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shit list
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in a position that
I don't wanna be in shit
I never had beef with you corny son of a bitches
But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm telling you right now
Motherfucker Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real
B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin
See he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin'
I'da never involved you
But you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known
That song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV
Now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin' weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props on that song you on national TV
Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him
Now you all in his thong
What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy
Up on stage screaming how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act
And don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song
I'm trying to prewarn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you dawg, I'm swingin' on you
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw
Up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all are some

Girls (y'all are some God damn girls)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies
You pussies keep talkin' shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, ha)
How fuckin' cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond
The beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked
See I was smart
I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I'll fight for Kim
All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all my dawgs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Melman
Till I'm hoist away
In my coffin
I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I never give a fuck
I won't ever be interested
Love me or hate me
As much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated
The shit that I been through
My pencil never could pencil
But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky
I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger
He sticks up his finger
I say fuck Christina
He says fuck Christina, but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method
To beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred
With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up punk
You're dead
Don't think that I'm playin'
And fuck Bizkit
'Cause I know you're sayin' fuck D12
Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves
Little

Girls (motherfucking females)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (now we all know the truth)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man

So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion

So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

And that's it
That's all there is to it dawg
If you don't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV
Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford
That's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say
I wouldn't a said shit
I woulda backed off
Did the motherfuckin song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it
That's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckingyou up shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards

I'm not a Muslim, but I still say Salaam (farsi or the language of many muslims meaning hello).

Can I write the songs to make the world sing?
Gee slim, with the rude gal demeanah (demeanor).
Happy to meet you, Miss Argentina.
Bob dobalina, taking my crown to hold me down.
I took it back, now he's crying the tears of the clown.
I slay Goliath with the mic in my hand,
But I still make the round on American Bandstand.
The foolproof plan, but is it calculated?
It can't be violated or even be imitated.
It's highly anticipated like: (strange noise)

We no longer supposed to be slaves
I bet Harriet Tubman would be turnin in her grave
Like remind my soul (remind my soul)

Of the time we were great before the self hate

My elders all feel the same, there's no bravery
You supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels?
So our youth don't get played out for fools
Or will they get programmed how to behave?
Malcolm X must be turnin in his grave

Bob Marley would be disturbed from his rest

Of the time we were great before the self hate

Can't work a dead end nine-to-five, for what?

The time we were great before the self hate

We're taught to worship these rappers and athletes and actors
Many who think they better and they'll walk right past ya

That really makes you worthy of the peoples support
But some brothers get those millions and forget how to behave
Arther Ashe must be turnin in his grave

Of the time we were great before the self hate

We crabs in a barrel, you ain't gettin out until I do first

Man, Martin must be turnin in his grave

Ricky Ticky Toc,Eminem,Rap,"Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should have never let us get off foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did

I'm waitin for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it
To fuckin' pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money

It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me 
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we rhyme like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other 
In time we discovered that we had more in common 
Then we thought with each other

Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in chunking cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'

I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet

Check The Blueprints,Kero One,Rap,"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin' off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and ain't a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But there's a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars, jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused...
Check the blueprint...

So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architect as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills...

So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead I'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel there's only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching...

And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
(Scratch)
So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see 'em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks... I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

So MC's, take it back to lyricism

With no cussing and shit

But I still gotta do this

Jingle jingle
We've go the lingo
With so much heat it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter 'cause I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance
Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down you and I niggas don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't want your bitch
'Cause sorry ass women just don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL
I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reafer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

And for sure
You've got yours
I've got mine's and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in on a party for sure

All right
Somebody play the potato
Let's take a ballad
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
'Cause we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth
And time to shine pitching a fit
'Cause somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
500 dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
'Cause y'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that anj and palmason and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets

Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old ragedy ass bitches wanna come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor
By the big screen TV where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw y'all a ragedy ass party
And y'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush

Assassination,Dead Prez,Rap,"Our people are poor,

This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

Murderation, modern hanging education
Price of your life is goin' up it ain't inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eatin by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pulled
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there ain't another place to run
Eat your own gun
Scared because my people never known fun

Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away
This E&J be freein us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way done
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
A truth that's riling
Mr. Charley keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin' niggas is dead
We learn the chokeholds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin' days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin' for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip

Hey, don't miss out on what you're passin
You're missin the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So, come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin
While suckers are hidin
Jump behind a bush when you see me's drivin by
Hangin out the window
With my magnum takin out some putos
Actin kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin paid from my vocal

Here is somethin you can't understand

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that he'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, ""Yo, it's on""
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome? 
Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him
But I did anyway (ha ha ha)
Young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

To light my spliff
Ignite you with insight
So, if you ain't down, bullshit
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time and play the role model?
No? I think you play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Hummin, comin at ya
Yeah, ya know I'm gonna gat ya
How do ya know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been
Understand where I'm coming from?
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here riskin my dome
Just for a bucket or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive
Yo, I gotta say ""fuck it""

Here is somethin you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Ayo, Bo knows this (what) and Bo knows that (what)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax and let yourself go
Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes, y'all (yes y'all)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all)
Real live, y'all (live y'all)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that) Brown
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
(Contact) Can I get a hit (hit)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

(True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means ""peace, see ya later""
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator
So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, motherafucka

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Here we go yo, here we go yo

As Long As The People Got Something To Say,Public Enemy,Rap,"(Chuck verse 1)
We don't control sht
No education
Enforcement
Economics
Depending on governments
Forever in a plantation state
Damn this is why I hate hate
Wanna do something for the people
Make us equal
Instead of creatures
Who got human features
Let the whole world reach you
Things classrooms can't teach you
Now can you dig it?
Sing the song till we all get along
Feed the poor
Damn the law
When they trained em, taught em
Killed 'em when they caught em
Set up wet up
When they no longer could afford em
Put disease across the seas
Got the third world on their knees
Get it
As long as the people got something to say

As long as the people got something to say

(Griff verse 2)
At this critical junction the administration can't function
Taking our civil liberties over high price luncheons it's nothin' when your considered a sheepole
As long as the people got something to say
""We the people""

They need a war to justify the taking of lives, they manage the lie behind the lie behind the lie.
Now you can't run and hide it's high tech genocide
They never taught you the truth or how to survive
They clone doctors to put a spin on it
Hip hop heads to shook to pull the cover off it.

It may effect there sales tip the scale
The way it looks they'll end up dead or in jail.

We busy spinning and grinning on 26's you sitting
Change your god for your wealth thinking heaven your gettin'.

You must be pre-sistance in mass resistance
Love thy enemy and make this commitment
To engage in struggle, with a clench fist lift it
Be true to self before the GOD end this.

Call me Kenny Anderson 'cause I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin' 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin' to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin' to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin' to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin' smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years

No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect

I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breakin
Speakin' of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin' around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin' the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin' around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair

Talent that I got will result to swat MCs I be burnin burnin hot
Whoa ho ho
Let me like slower with the flow
If movin quick ow you just won't know
I'm homicidal when ya enter the target
Niggas get up act like a pig tryin' to hog shit
So I'll take yur ass out quick
The mics are mad at my nigga
You can suck my dick
If you wanna step to to my mother fuckin' rent
(Chik chik) Bow Bow Bow Blown to death
)You got shot cause your knock knock knock
Whose there another motherfuckin hard rock
Slackin' on your mackin' cause raws what ya lack you want to react bring it on back

Shame on you when you step through to the o'l dirty bastard

What my nigga"
I Go To Work,Kool Moe Dee,Rap,"I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic you got to like the way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin' and explodin'

On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that is of which I chose
To make a rhyme and chill then you know

I will fulfill to make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy if he's a sucker

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work, I go to work, I go to work"
#1,Nelly,Rap,"Uh Uh Uh
I just gotta bring it to they attention Dirty, that's all

You better watch who you talkin' 'bout
Runnin' yo mouth like you know me
You gonna fuck around and choke
Why the show nigga' carnies
Show me
While one on one you can't hold me if your last name was hand
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on ya pants
No resident of France
But you swear I'm from Paris
Hundered 6 karats
Total?, naw that's per wrist
Tryin' to compare this
My chains to yo chains
I'm like Sprint or Motorola, no service, outta ya range
You're outta ya brains, thinkin' I'm a shout out ya name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to get ya fame
All this pressure you applyin, it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blind side
Takin' your sleeves off
As much as we floss
Still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin', bitchin' and cryin', suck it up as a loss
'Cause yo acts is wack
Yo whole label is wack
And matter of fact eh eh-eh eh eh
Hold that

I am number one
No matter if you like it here take it sit down and write it

Mad 'cause I got mine
Oh don't wind up on the flat line
Oh if my uncle could see me now

Straight emulatin my style right to the down down
Can't leave out the store now
Betta wait till the calm down

Come and askin yo where the party
Oh lordy, will I continue to act naughty
Mixin' Cris' and Bacardi

Half the time you be the niggas who's fuckin' album flop
You know, boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
Mad 'cause I'm hot, he just mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta give me my props
Just give me tha yachts
Give me my rocks
And keep my fans comin' in flocks
Till you top the Super Bowl
Keep your mouf on lock (shhhh, I'm awake haha)
I'm cocky on the mic
But I'm humble in real life
Take nothin' for granted
Blessing everything on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncooth (so crazy)
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreadin the loot
With my - family and friends
And my - Closest to kin
And I - Do it again
If it means I'ma win

Hypocrite,Akrobatik,Rap,"One, two
Can you hear me?
Yo, Fakts One's again, yeah
Yo, my name is Akrobatik and I don't smoke crack
I won't buy the rhyme if I think the beats whack
I don't shoot smack or pop pills to get loose
And I don't drink liquor it causes spousal abuse
Plus I don't smoke cigarettes
So you won't see me on the patch or chewing on no nicorette
I don't pack heats, but if I did you couldn't hold it
And I won't smoke a spliff unless I see you role it
I don't talk shit, shit-talkers are mostly feeble
Don't look down on my people, we all equal
I don't watch videos, they all the same
Don't preoccupy myself with glamour, fortune and fame
The mic a fight but don't sleep the head skills is tight
So don't be the one to break my peaceful streak, aight?
I don't do none of that shit
But if I do it's just because I'm hypocrite just like you
Hypocrite, low down dirty belligerent
Words and actions always different, ignorant
Everything you say is insignificant
Soul is old, rhymes dirty, born illegitimate
Can't believe a word you say
What you claim you do tomorrow
You ain't doing today
I bet we'd all be your slaves if you had it your way
But you wouldn't follow none of the rules that you lay
You damn hypocrite!
I won't do a show without half up front
Fourth and one best believe I'm on punt
If you see me with a honey, best believe she's at least half black
'Cause I won't hit the booty unless it's tight fat
I won't hop a flight without the blade stash
Slice your neck if you make the cockpit-dash
I don't sweat cash, cause it comes and goes
And I try not to call women bitches and hoes
But if a ho spread a rumor I ain't smacking the bitch
I walk past her faster than a Pedro pitch
'Cause I don't sweat the words of those that don't matter
The rhymes are above petty talk and ignorant chatter
I don't waste my time writing ignorant rhymes
But I know that making niggaz laugh ain't no crime
I don't do none of that shit but if I do
It's just because I'm a hypocrite just like you
Hypocrite, low down dirty belligerent
Words and actions always different, ignorant
Everything you say is insignificant
Soul is old, rhymes dirty, born illegitimate
Can't believe a word you say
What you claim you do tomorrow
You ain't doing today
I bet we'd all be your slaves if you had it your way
But you wouldn't follow none of the rules that you lay
You damn hypocrite! (Fakts One's again)
You damn hypocrite!"

Don't start a war unless your dough's up, nigga

Y'all shouldn't cry about it, grow up nigga
Guess what y'all? I know magic

Death threats - it ain't phase me
When I bring the T-Mac through the Rucker y'all, it ain't Tracy
Sewed up nigga, low cut nigga
So keep talin bout your wrists froze up nigga
You might see 30 whips roll up nigga
We be at the pawn shop givin' your Rol' up nigga

You'll find out the hard way if your On*Star works, cause

How you want it, long nose or the trey snub nigga?
Return and die dog, if I start clappin in your crib
Nah I ain't tryin' to turn the lights off
Trapped on the chain, got the jewels and cape
Be like Jared, Subways made him lose his weight, but look
I'm bout gettin' money for all races
Only oldie but goodie I know is small faces
Wait, make you sure you heard right; woulda been put the hit out
But I ain't tryin' to get my third strike

Wake up nigga, stakes up nigga
For all my locked-down and my cased-up niggaz, cause

Who's that nigga? New cat nigga
Don't disrespect, don't do that nigga
Hate to hear the sound of the tool clap nigga
Dual strap nigga when I do black niggaz
First hand with a three-eighty kickback
Brains on your lap dog, babysit that
Look, it's my turf, get up off the stoop now
I'm Omar Epps, who got the ""Juice"" now?
Street love nigga, G's up nigga
You lookin' for a loan on your re-up nigga
Haters might wanna put hollows in ya
When you're young black spendin like a lotto winner y'know
I'm grown up now, I'm done with Jake
When I say pounds y'all I'm talkin' bout London cake
I can serve it to you uncut or somethin' baked
Hope you ready for me folks, 'cause I'm comin' your way, cause

Rise,Flobots,Rap,"So much pain we
Don't know how to be but angry
Feel infected like we've got gangrene
Please don't let anybody try to change me
Me
Just me
In the middle of a sea full of faces
Full of faces
Some laugh some salivate
What's in your alleyway
Recycling bins or bullet cases
It's not equal
It's not fair
Were different people
But we're not scared
We ain't never scared
To pave a new path
Make a new street
Build a new bridge
Say can you see by the dawns early light
Free slaves running
Songs words weren't right
Now a new days coming
The few stay stunning while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
The base drumming is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons
And

Rise together
We rise together
(Repeated several times)

Lost hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream universities
Or you and I verse the tees
React automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency amber to red like the turning leaves
Oh please let the hurting cease
Don't let apathy police the populace
We will march across
Those stereotypes that were marked for us
The answers obvious
We switch the consonants
Change the sword to words and lift continents

Rise together
We rise together
(Repeated several times)

If you believe in redemption
I'm calling to you from another dimension
(Repeated several times)"
Jam 4 U,Redman,Rap,"*Inhales, starts coughing*
Yo, this is for motherfuckers -- that talk that sellout shit

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

""Get down, get down, on down.."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!"" rhythm and funk
Makes you hump like Technotronic I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
'Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""To chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ah, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew I'm twenty-two and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Till they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a bu-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-dan-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
'Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... On your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)"

No, that's the only shit you gonna here right now on this album.

Ain't the case. We just like saying shit like that just to fuck with
You. Ey, I told you to hold him down know he running,
But... fuck it! (gunshot) God damnit it if you had of just stayed still

Ice Ice Baby (Radio Edit),Vanilla Ice,Rap,"Yo, VIP, let's kick it

Ice Ice Baby
Ice Ice Baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance! Go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony

Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon

Burning 'em if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo

Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say, ""hi""
Did you stop? No, I just drove by

Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo
So, I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue

Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack

Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene, just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground

'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this

Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, ""Damn""
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram

Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

Ice Ice Baby

All Ready!
Hold on, hold up a second 'cause
Boys comin' down blue or red
Down here pimpin' ain't dead
Grindin' daily to stack my bread
I from the place where girls jump fly
Now a days the brauds pimp brauds
'Cause they got more game then most these guys
You'll get set up and then you'll get robbed
You don't know bout' chunkin' a deuce
You don't know 'bout a southside fade
Down here we be ridin' d's
But you don't know about choppin blades
Texas southern or Prarie View
What you know bout' battle of the bands
Down here we got ghetto girls
Like wings, chicken or Timmy Chan's
You can catch me ridin' swangs
What you know about sippin' syrup
You don't know about pourin' it up
Purple drank some speeches slurred
You don't know bout' the way we talk
Boys say we got country words
But I don't really care what you heard
'Cause you don't know bout' the Dirty 3rd

(Snippets from U.G.K. songs Bun-B (Pimp-C))
They don't know what that scar bout'
They don't know what that bar bout'
They don't know what that candy car bout'

Or smokin' that joint about
Texas is the home of the playas and pimps
Showin' naked ass in the great state of Tex'
3rd Coast Born I mean we're Texas raised

Perfect Jab (Explicit),Heltah Skeltah,Rap,"(Rock)
Yo word up man
Word up man, it's a lot of niggaz out there
Niggaz pullin gats and all that shit
I know we magnum force, and all of that
We run with o.g.c.'s n shit
We'll fuck your ass up too, word up
Bummy jab, mr. perfect, equals perfect jab
Word is bond

This whole shit's played, like jordache and sassoon
Sue me it's time, that y'all ass out like baboons
Or me with no drawers on, the way my pants droop, bang
To your equilibrium, you're physically dismantled

(Supreme)
Batten down the hatches, I mastered this flow I crafted
Beyond sight, comin' out fights with no scratches
To let tactics, knock the world off it's axis
Supreme mean the lastest level, you can't pass this

(Rock)
We'll tell them hold this, heat-seekin' fist'll never miss
On impact, set to knock shit out the devilish
Punk who step to this, my ring got ice you can have some
For your glass jaw, bloody mary's ain't that bad son
Jab's a one man riot starter, tell your dad to come
When I get to snuffin bwoy you'll wish you had a gun
Havin' fun yet? mr. perfect's the one who says who
Get hurt next, suplexin all of you?

(Supreme)
You got nowhere to run ta, I'ma hunter like a fonzo
Smoke you like fonta, leave you in mourning like alonzo
Comin' for your head honcho, he in my range, ain't nuttin changed duke
If you can't stand the rain you better wear a poncho
Run through your crew pronto, crush you like nachoes
Yeah you act macho but you still run from the cops duke
Supreme is not your, ordinary type of guy
When I get hyper, I burn that ass like all types of lye

(Rock)
All right all right all right, maybe I'm not the best, but I'm one of em
See these wack cats, think they nice, we make fun of em

(Supreme)
'Cause we runnin' em, back to they blocks for reinforcement
I stay flossin, you bring your crew I bring the four-fifths

(Rock)
Known to jab, 'cause I move like a rook straight at cha
And drop mad niggaz with one punch, usually that one
Left to right my shit is marvelous like marvin hagler
Stagger a devil sayin', ""go the fuck back to Africa""

It's the per-fect jab (jab) at last (last)
I break dudes in half (half)
Get splashed on your staff, if you don't know the math


(Call 'em perfect)
I bring shit they can't fathom, sent to hurt shit
It ain't worth it, bummy jab sent to dab em
Since the days of adam, befo' eve flipped the script
It was predicted, for me to bring some shit like this
(That boy bad, that boy bad!)
But now we out to bring 'em back terror, I'm bout cheddar
(Hah!) they call me mr. perfect
'Cause I'm, simply without error (per-fect-o)
You couldn't weather my endeavor, I'm too clever
Don't ever bring it to my square queer you know better
And if you creep up (what?) prepare to meet the grim reaper
Appearin in your nightmares, fuckin' your sleep up

(Rock)
Oh, oh, oh, b.t.j.'s call me balboa, swan call me rock-ola
Hold the fort down, reach out and punch somethin' like a motorola
Own a pager, bonus how I call the paper, you make all the dough
But anyway I slay a boa anyday, you know what?
I may just take you over, my wager's
To get your face or your nose bloodied, what?
The r-o-to, c-k ya show ya greater, don't fuck around
Burn caps like my name like was coca-cola
Wait up hold up! don't make a, nigga roll up
Take your shines, leave ya swoll up or with a taste of
Somethin' smacked out your mouth, so ah, slow up I hate ya
Do your dirty m.p. now stands for make'em pay brah

I'm rude, abuse dudes that come late on they dues

Niggaz get hauled off, suplexin magnums like I'm goin' off

(Rock)
You fuckin' cornballs, we comin' from another angle completely
My theory is, can't none of y'all faggot niggaz beat me
Get snuffed so stupid you may curse your dad, it's his fault

Ugly Bitches (LP Version),Coolio,Rap,"A bitch is a bitch and we all know
That a ho is a ho wit a toe-up slut so
If you're gotta have em, might as well be a fine one
But it seems that some niggas can't seem to find one
So they go and get a bitch that's lookin' like Trixie
And Hekkyl and Jekkyl wit some saggy ass titties
A big fat flagrant hoodrat hooker
And the nigga got the nerve to pretend she's a hooker
Sportin that down from your arm like a Simpson
Talk about bitches that you wish you was pimpin'
Come around the homies and you swear that she's playin'
But every time I see her, you're beggin
Go get you a girl that got somethin' goin'
Get rid of that bitch that's lookin' like a dragon
Now you wanna fight 'cause you're baggin on your Mrs
But that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches

When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
But now that I'm grown I leave 'em alone
'Cause I went from rags to riches

They say 'beauty is skin deep' but goddamn weeded bitch
Look like buckwheat mixed with opi
Toe up, toe up, straight from the floor
And her bad ass breath is about to make me throw up
Niggas started dissin and you blamed it on the gin
But the very next day you was with the bitch again
Now your ass is gettin' clowned like Bozo
But that's what you get for fuckin' with that ugly ho
I don't know what possessed you, nigga
Stand that hooker in front of a trigger
Spendin your time with a big goony-goo-goo
To niggas like you I gotta say ""Choo choo""
Dig a ditch down in desperation
Send that monster on a permanent vacation
The girl is chop-top, but you don't listen
'Cause some niggas like fuckin' with ugly bitches

When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
But now that I'm grown I leave 'em alone
'Cause I went from rags to riches

Aw shit, there go my nigga pretendin he don't see me
Talkin' with a bitch that look like a flea G
Holdin' her hand as he walks through the plaza
I try to play it off but I couldn't hold my laughter
The girl is done so take her ass off the oven
Put her on a BOOM and send her back to the covent
Cookin up a plan in a big, black cauldron
And the dumb ass nigga don't know that he's fallin'
Into a trap 'cause now the whore is pregnant
9 months later and she's squirted on an insect
He don't wanna claim it, she went and got a test
Now he's sendin child support in a big fat cheque
My nigga got depressed and he started drinkin' liquor
One night he got drunk, went to her house and killed her
Riches to rags and rags to riches
But that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches

When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
It seems that it's sad for this pussy I had
Came from some ugly bitches
When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
It seems kinda sad 'cause this pussy I had
Came from some ugly bitches

So you mean to tell me you fuckin' with a bald-headed, ol' fat, lumpy,
Droopy, crack baby look-a-like, cisco drinkin', loud, ignorant, fucked-up
Teeth, stank hoodrat, won't down, once-a-month bleedin, butthead swap-meet,
AFDC, leaned-over tennis shoe, cigarette butt baggin bitch? Nigga what's
Wrong wit you?
(That's all right. She take care of a nigga though, that's all I know nigga.
That's OK yeah, that's OK nigga)"
Hold Your Hand,Del The Funky Homosapien,Rap,"Full of cobras, yolla, dosia stands Soldiers roll as hoes come to hold your hand What they told ya is bogus, motive scams Payola for motorolas and coco plants Ask the bitch why you attracted to a older man If you play you better know your hand They be po-po fans Loco in the cabeza Possessive, no questions Hoe sexes for yo necklace Self esteem low Pimps get the green dough Extreme show of gratitude for slapping you I'ma rapper with actual facts for you Look at that, that's what crack will do, zappin fools Make the most attractive boo turn transient Lost in the ambience pantiless, scantily dressed She like give me a kiss, a price for pimps with a pantry of flesh for your cash But it can't be a check

I ain't mesmerized by a pleasure promise with lies It won't twist my brain if a bitch complain I'ma analyze wisely the situations, see if shit you saying is warranted If so, I'll more than give my all to correct any flaws If you in denial, by hoe I can't hold your hand, you're tool old for that I don't know them cats Should I order straps?

I can tell she got that thing by the way that she walking (walking)
Love that dang a lang by the way that she talking (talking)
Baby got dem goodies, think she wanna do me,

Her bubble, gets me in trouble, you can call it too excel, ima call it double

Now I'm bout to take her back to school

Her back pack full of school supplies
WHOO! Her thighs make me scoop her,
Back in round like a tuba
Got a trunk on her, front keeps me wantin her
Mad at her for that, matta fact I need to have that in the back
Tap it in the sack, don't know how to act when I'm round ya
She gave me that look, like I'm about to clown ya
I hound ya for a piece of that, how's about a squeeze on that
I'm easy, like Sunday morning ill give up my cheese for that
Thick miss, Krizz is the pick for your wish list
Get bent, you'll get to picture the bidness
She make 'em all geek when they view that
I told you, she got a back pack, but you already knew that

She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too
Cheatin' when I'm sittin' next to you, baby
She got her backpack, and I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm bout to take her back to school

Baby just shake ya, your money maka
Looked her up and down and said, mmm ill take ya
Break out my wallet, pay for the watcha ma call it
Knew she had a backpack from the front, fo I saw it

Hope her and all the girls come on and follow us
Them 816 Boyz, brand new rat pack
Lookin' for them girls (HEY) packin them backpacks

She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too

Wants Vs. Needs,Haiku D'Etat,Rap,"Forgetting the things you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed

Abstract Rude
You want wine need water
These rhymes we offer the kind of authors
To knock ya out of ignorance
End of the innocence begin to the finishing
With the men significant welfare recipients
Tragic
Addicts with a bad habit
Somebody's baby's momma at the Carter
In the new jack city
Oh what a pity
This again locked up for soliciting
Oldest profession the men buy
So it's selling
You want pork need veggies
For your bone support be ready for armageddi
Hold the fort down
Go through the court trial get acquitted
Be committed to the sacrifice
It's a lotta pie
Ab get a slice

And tell me how bad you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me mow much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need

Mikah 9
Right about now a nigga drunk
Been smoking some ole janky
Rolled stress blunts I want skunk
I really want my baby momma cunt
She kick it with punks
When I know a family man what she want
Bitch made niggas on the rag every month
I should just punt fools like footballs
My goals to make you look
Yo I could call some stunts
From porno industries
Or get some from in the streets
Shady heat that's meant for me
But what I want and what I need
Should be about me and my seeds
Cause sometimes I have flashbacks
Of chopping crack and weed
Moving X and LSD having sex with more than 3
Busting checks for 50 gees
Cashing checks and pushing keys
Vexed and connects with the greed I process
Take the rolex off your wrist
Take the roladex off your desk
But in the long run I'm a strong son
Those klepto days done my life reflects
Universal cause and effect in every action
I'm sorry my karma ran over your dogma
Loved one don't be upset
We can still pop a bottle then we can get lit up and wet
The common ground is the love we all express
Whoever got a problem with that deserves what they get

Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need

Aceyalone
Man, I want money I need food
I want clothes I need housing I want cars
I need good health I need knowledge of self
I got knowledge of self I want peace but I need help
I want to do right but I need the mic
I want wings but they gave me a bike
I need light I want the blacks to know they need the facts
I want a Cadillac but I need tracks to make stacks
I want a million in the bank and a pound of dank
But I need to think 'cause I could sink
And get caught up in the funk stank
I want to pull rank but I need to be a saint
And so I need a prayer and after that I need a drink
'Cause I want to be wanted need
To be needed but I want to stay blunted
And need to be weeded for my own goodness sake
I want to escape but I need to set you straight
So tell me how bad do you want it punk
And tell me how much of it's greed
Versus getting the things that you want pumpkin
Or getting the things that you need sucker

Forgetting the things you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed"
Ill Culinary Behaviour,DJ Format,Rap,"(Feat. Abdominal)

(VERSE 1: Abdominal)
Well hello and welcome
If you could wipe your feet on the doormat
Please, come in - oh Format...
We got company, where's my manners, let me take your coats
I hope you're hungry for some flavorful quotes
Which I whipped up myself, I'm really hopin that you like it
I call it the Abdominal Special, I eat a hype dish
Format? I think he's still in the kitchen
Slavin over platters, you know, cooking rhythms
Come again? Oh, he said that the beats are finished
I guess all that's left to do is just remix it
You say you wanna help, okay, how about you set the table
And what's this, a beautiful patch cable, for me?
Really, you shouldn't have
Please excuse me, I'ma just go and grab
A spare apron to keep your gear fresh
Format, where's the food, it's rude, we have guests

(CHORUS: Abdominal)
Dinner's served, so yo, come and get it
Abdominal and Format cookin up the splendid
Concoctions, explosions of flavor
Check the ill culinary behaviour
You need seconds? Yo, come and get it
Abdominal and Format whippin up the splendid
Delicacies, explosions of flavor
Check the ill culinary behaviour

(VERSE 2: Abdominal)
Okay, you're right here, and if you could sit there
Format needs the chair closest to the kitchen
In case he needs to fix the snare
Which I'm sure will be crispy enough
Ah-ah-ah, we're all hungry, but before we tuck
In and stuff our faces, we really must say graces
My turn, so here goes, Lord, thank you for bangin' beats we lace
And of course the microphones that we rap into
Amen, that's through, so let's eat, pass the loops, bro
Soup? No, I said loops, so
Delicious with the fishes, nutritious
Servin' roasted rapper, that's the first dish on my wish list
Just gobble it up, then proceed to lick the plate clean
Taste the cuisine whipped up by the great team
Of culinary experts, Ab and a digit
Between 3 and 5 followed by a non-shiny finish
For-mat for the punchline-inept
Keep eating cause there's tons of food left
Really, you just have to taste some home-cooked

(DJ Format cuts up)
(Actin' ill)
(Actin' ill)
(Actin' ill)

(Watch your behaviour)

(VERSE 3: Abdominal)
I got the feeling that everybody is ready for dessert to be served
But before I bring it out I got somethin' to say first
Abdominal Junior, you will get nothing, young man
Until you finish those breaks on your plate
Cause all across the land there be starvin MC's
Who'd be happy to rock to beats like these
You should be a little bit more considerate
And think of this before pushing your dish away without finishing it
And while I'm at it, get your elbows off the damn console
Really, where's your manners?
I'm ashamed to have to scold you right in front of our guests
But you leave me no choice
I'm truly sorry that I had to raise my voice
But my son's behaviour simply inexcusable
And if I don't see some improvement soon, my fuse'll blow
Is that clear, mister? Good, I'm glad we understand one another
Now go help your brother Little Format
Clear the table, put the leftovers in some Tupperware
So tomorrow we'll have supper prepared
Oh what's that, you say you must be leaving?
Such a pity, what a lovely evening
Well, thanks for coming, we must do it again sometime
I hope you ate enough - of our beats and rhymes

(This mornin for breakfast I had bacon, egg and chips
Three cups of tea, a man to smack me lips
I said to John me husband, ""Ain't I gettin' fat?""

But he's kiddin, you know?
Why do I got to be fat?
Why have I got to be fat?

Ambush In The Night,Looptroop,Rap,"Samples: Graffiti vandals can be hard to catch,
It's a huge problem, All out war on graffiti, Two out of every three
Cans were stolen out of your typical neighbourhood store,
And what happens to the kids convicted of graffiti offences

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Scratch: Vandal squad on my case
Getting chased raided but mostly getting shit painted
(Chorus and scratch 2x)

(Promoe)
Yo, it was me and Suer, right. On a Tuesday night
Had green, brown, black, two blue shades and white
Cosm.i.c stayed home but BIF crew stay tight
Staking out the steel dragon for a true spray fight
In other words a backjump
Wishing that we wouldn't bumb into them wack chumps
Cause the lay-ups getting crowded after sunset
Which is cool but get in line cause it ain't your fucking turn yet
Gotta burn shit can't come up with no lame style piece
If you wanna tame the wild beast
Had better burn murder the red worm spread germs in the system
To make heads turn
And snap necks at the central stations
Young kids making cops run like mental patients
Don't they know that graffiti can't be stopped
Writers unlike rappers can't go pop
So they stay underground till the day graff is legalized
Civil eyes look upon us as evil guys
Though we trod one away on third rails in front of metal giants
Death defiant to cops we keep lying
In the bushes ambushes being plotted clean trains being spotted
Signed like there was dotted
Lines on the sides of the iron monsters
Representing VK mafia, call us bombsters

Sample: This is what the detectives are gonna consider a bombing.
Were they take a specific chunk of a neighbourhood and they
Absolutely destroy it.

Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Scratch

(Supreme)
They just run off like we were teflon by the blink of an eye they gone
Didn't fit in the soccer team as kids so they started out wrong
That makes sence that's why they started to bomb
Behind bars is were they really belong
It's like a life style for these teens they all wear hooded sweatshirts
Listen to rap music move in criminal networks
They're mainly from the suburbs socially dysfunctional
A young graffiti writer soon a fullfeathered criminal
Our chances are minimal to lead 'em back to the right side of the track
They refer to legal as wack
They lack respect for authority, for taxpayers
Their own parents pay this it's about the papers
They're supposed to be decent yes sayers
But now they trash like punkrocks and ravers
Hellraisers raised by failures and fools
What we need are some rules in the public schools
If this make us look bad and by the end of the day
That's what really matters the people in charge say
They need the public to believe everything's working all right
What they don't know won't hurt them right
I mean on one hand it's not that dangerous but it
Looks bad on the other
And the voters are stupid they judge the book by it's cover

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets we patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Sample: Establish a graffiti unit to combat the problem
Crack down on graffiti

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets we patrol on
Trying to get a hold a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

(Cosm.i.c)
You trying to get a hold on us kids strapped with Krylon
But for too long people believed in your fiction
That graffers came from broken homes with drug addictions
Get the picture it's a mixture of four ingredients
Kept alive by cats who truly believe in them
I won't be naming them but this one in this time
Is still non-sellout maybe that's why it's still a crime
How many real graff writers we got here tonight?
Pump your fist for what you believe is right
These northern light emcee characters won't take any shit from suckers
With pockets packed with badges
Still the baddest in any weather in any season
Whether political or for the fuck of it reasons
Teasing society like a spot in your rear
This generation heroes nightshift volunteers

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Scratch

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Belton

Scratch: Getting chased, raided but mostly getting shit painted
Ey yo, graff can't be faded

Sample: Kids don't think that graffiti is a crime.
They need to understand that personal property belongs to other people,
And they don't have the right to damage it"
Foreign Exchange Title Theme,The Foreign Exchange,Rap,"Thank you for the music, thank you for my life
Thank you for the good, bad, wrong and the right
Thank you for my laughter, thank you for my name

Electric Relaxation,A Tribe Called Quest,Rap,"Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate

Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

HOME SWEET HOME,Smif-n-Wessun,Rap,"(Tek)
This is the story of a place, that we call home
Where the kids pack heat when it's time to roam
Everybody's on the scramble, life's a gamble
Hoppin on the white horse, tryin' to get a handle
On the fast pace that we call the last race
Step wit precaution when you enter this place
We got a spot on every block that makes ya dreams come true
Just come correct wit the snapses or ya doo
Don't come cryin broke, still tryin' to cop the dope
What parts of no, do not you understand bro
We can't afford to take shorts or be playing sports
Empires need to be built, mack 10's bought
Or even caught for them deceased ass hustlers
And we still got the pound for ya living muthafuckas
What goes around comes back to the roots
See you at the revolution and Crooklyn, true

We live in Brooklyn baby
We try to make it baby
We gonna make it baby
We live in Brooklyn baby

(Steele)
Another day, another dollar dead
Pigs rushin the crib to catch a collar now I'm fed
What the face now, me and my people's taste crown
Stayin face down, while K-9's sniffs around
What they found was irrelevant, the weed 'cause
They was sent to represent and cause a ruckus amongst us
Now I got more pigs rushin we, handcuffin me
Takin' hold of we, in the custody
For blushin in, rasta boy restin in peace
After going through the bullshit, we in release
To hit the streets, where the war still off for all of y'all
'Cause they kept rule locked behind the wall
No time at all, no fake, no jacks
Perhaps when the gat spins, niggas won't even know what happen
I'll be glad when my man come home
'Cause in the zone muthafuckas grab ya chrome

(Chorus (with Tek shoutin out))

The eye three time, as lead transpire
Currency change, change from yours to mine
Greenbacks talk bullshit, floats on water
Pager goin' off, call comin' from headquarters
I was told if the secret code appears
It means some bwoy want dead, prepare for warfare

Fuck the truth, we bringin' the noose for ya loose talk
So think smart, or rest in parts if ya do start
I fucks wit, the poor, so fuck being rich
Word is bond, there's a muthafuckin war goin' on
Stand strong, on ya own two, mista
Or come confront the grim ripper
Black hoodie on, black dusty fatigues
Bloody red afro, puffin on the black weed (on three)
He lurks in the shadow, so when you sleep in the battle
That'll be, and tell ya punk lib to tattle

Salute, to each and every hood label truth
Doin' what you gotta do to bring in the loot
Huh, the time has come for armageddion
Give nurture to your seeds, and load up ya guns, dunn
Now catchin vibes, that somethin' ain't right
Gettin' little hits, stomach fillin up tight
Damn, these little nappy head cheap trait bastards
Run around town wit the cronz trynna blast shit
Ain't nothin' sweat like the dark streets of Bedstuy
Creepin' population, endin up in C.I.

Take a ride through the Flatbush side
See the dred and he caught for support, hit me off wit the lye
Now slide, through the ville, death row, say hello
To the fam that stick to K.I.M. that's planned
Toward the east, somethin's goin' on
So burn the buds, and all my people in Medina stay strong

Vomitspit,MF Doom,Rap,"It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin' never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell yous
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, ""Daddy funk me""
I'm like anywho's
Seeds walkin' all out in street without any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory glory, it's like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated in deep theta
Let her hate the creep later
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ewww
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit (DOOM)"
Soap Bar,Goldie Lookin Chain,Rap,"Burned a new hole in my tracksuit today,
Smoking Soap Bar without an ashtray,
Red-hot nylon dripping on my skin,
I ripped the fucker off, and threw it in the bin,
Soap Bar's cheap, and so's my clothes,
They've got to be cause of all the fucking holes,
It tastes like shit and it makes you cough,
And it's the fucking rubber in it that gets you off.

Yeah, I smoke Soap Bar with lots of bits of plastic,
I leaves mine in it cause it tastes fantastic,
Skunk costs too much, I can't see the appeal,
Of smoking Port Rocky, Soap Bar or Gold Seal,
Smoke Rocky in a bong, bucket or hot-knives,
Bake it in a cake for your Mam as a surprise,
I smokes Green, and it's gone in an instant,
But Soap Bar lasts, 'cause it's fucking consistent.

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I'll smoke Soap Bar till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Last night I went out driving in my car,
I sparked up a fat spliff of fucking Soap Bar,
A Blim-burn burned right down to my dick,
And while I was distracted, I fucking crashed into a
Brick wall, the car was fucking battered,
The bonnet flipped up and the windscreen shattered,
You're better off smoking The Green instead,
Cause it don't Blim-Burn and it's better for your head.

Soap Bar! Sitting in a deep sweat,
Thinking! I've got to get some Rocky for the,
Weekend! The sight of Draw excites me,
Stick it in a bong, light it up and chug a fucking,
Whitey! Burning holes in my tracky,
This shit always happens when I'm smoking fucking Rocky,
You've heard it on the news; you've seen it on the telly,
Add up for moving Soap Bar down fucking Liz Werry
""I do it like a little cause light the fucking thing as always""
I used to smoke Skunky but it was far too smelly, man!

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I'll smoke Soap Bar till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Most Soap Bar comes from fucking Holland,


They make it out of oil, and tires and pollen,
Diesel, Miramar, Flat-Press too;
These are types of Soap Bar available to you,
These little bits of plastic you find inside;
You can use those as a quality guide,
Of the standard of Soap Bar that you are smoking,
The more bits of plastic means the better the toking.

Eat a Hash-cake but wait a while,
It'll take about an hour ain't Draw versatile,
You can burn it, eat it, or smoke it in a spliff,
Space shakes, Draw gateau's, you knows it Delia Smith,
Lying in your bed dropping blimps on your pubes,
Selling Draw to your mates but it's really Oxo cubes,
When you're cooking up draw, be quick don't lick it,
'Cause it's really fucking hot and it'll burn your fingers.

This bloke said to me; ""You haven't got a clue,
About the damage that Soap Bar can do to you"",
I tried to see things from his point of view,
But I couldn't fit my head up his asshole too,
The bloke was wrong, I knows my stuff,
I knows if I smoke it, I'm gonna feel rough,
My lungs are fucked and my throat is raw,
Cause the thing about Soap Bar; it's fucking hardcore.

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I'll smoke Soap Bar till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Well anyway I think it's better myself to lean forwards,
When smoking Soap Bar, because you are less likely to Blim-Burn,
You know what I mean?

Innit, check it out man! I got some quality fucking Gold-Seal for you, innit?

Shape up all those little bits of plastic what you find inside, right,
And then fucking stick them in a teapot,
Makes a lovely cup of tea, that does.

What I do, stick a fag in the microwave, right,
You toke it up, you sticks the Draw on top,
And you rams it in a bong and you rams the bong in your fucking head.

Yeah that's like my fucking lungs feel like,
They're fucking collapsing sometimes from the Soap Bar like,
You know?"

Unemployed Black Astronaut,Busdriver,Rap,"I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon... (Or possibly, one of the great all-time bus-drivers.)

It's the resurgence of the happy black rappers
But our African medallions are handicap placards.
I am alphabetized in the ""modernized retro""
And my press photos are wallet sized. My rent's low.
Why don't you shape me? I'm malleable flesh and putty
and a salad bowl with ??? dressing
and assimilated into urban fuel testing
Dress and doggy are coveted by a sexy bunny
afraid I'll add her to my burlesque show. 
Who's slipping the ring finger of the lead singer ??? fresh bowl.
All the bitches rule with bee stingers but I'm refreshed though.
It's home of the black speed reader.
Perplexed or blurb stretched
Dude suggests that I'm spacy but the bird's nest is low.
Which means I'm commonplace.
Til the boy and me traveled the country in wooden spaceships
On the phone cursing at de-booking agents.
I wield words and pilfer the country with the underground who's-who
But I feel like I've been sodomized with a billiards pool cue.

I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon.
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace.
I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon.
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace.

It's the return of the all popular dope rappers
Who retreat through holes in the sky, climbing up rope-ladders
And I will sell you a silver disc soaked in laughter, 
Cause you've been brainwashed. Out of your ears leaks soap lather
Why don't you deify me? I'm Buckaroo Banzai.
Don't know what to do, I'm the wrong guy.
I touch crews like Krush Groove on DVD
And I kinda started doing songs with CVE?
But now you're like (Chillin' Villain who? Project what?) 
Persona Non Grata with the wrist-band in front of Popsicle stick man. 
He's a wall of hot lava. Drip crayons on your clipped glands.
So I found the top dollar. Twist trends to enrich fans.
But there's not a lotta offers that give grants to kitsch bands.
And I water lawns for the ADD D&D role-players
And we got along, so we formed a commonwealth
And you hear me through random sightings and file-sharing
And you tell me that song writing's like child bearing
No it's not, it's self indulgence
Elven culprits watch their egos melt in charcoal pits.

I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon.
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace.

Oh my. Sorry I left my acceptance speech in the back of the private car
And I re-wrote the Hollywood ending, fluxed the motion-picture screen
Made it so the black guy doesn't die by the opening scene.

Yeah! This is the climate of cathartic writer
That enables whos-who in the market they lifer.
I've been out-sold and my styles are old and lame
I'll spark a lighter to the carpet fiber 'cause I'm not a household name.

I'm a tax write-off, I signed a deal with no exit clause.
My label's like Ms. Santa Clause on menopause, so I'm banging on padded walls.
So I'm trying to make hits, but I keep hitting pop flies
I don't eat out any more, I'm thawing chicken pot pies
But I used to be in the list of the top five
Fresh hip-hop guys.

In The Ghetto,Eric B. & Rakim,Rap,"Planet Earth was my place of birth
Born to be the sole controller of the universe
Besides the part of the map I hit first
Any a rhyme that I can adapt when it gets worst
The rough gets going, the going gets rough
When I start flowing, the mic might bust
The next state, I shake from the power I generate
People in Cali used to think it was earthquakes
'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard
So I vote God and never get scarred and gauled
But it seems like I'm locked in hell
Looking over the edge but the R never fell
A trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip
Stand on my own two feet and come equipped
Any stage I'm seen on, or mic I fiend on
I stand alone and need nothing to lean on
Going for self with a long way to go
So much to say but I still flow slow
I come correct and I won't look back
'Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)

I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York
And return through the womb of the world as a thought
Thinking how hard it was to be born
Me being cream with no physical form
Millions of cells with one destination
To reach the best part, it's life creation
9 months later, job well done
Make way, 'cause here I come
Since I made it this far, I can't stop now
There's a will and a way and I got the know-how
To be all I can be and more
And see all there is to see before
I'm called and go back to the essence
It's alot to learn so I study my lessons
I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
I'm glad I listen when my father was rapping to me
'Cause back in the days, they lived in caves
Exiled from the original man, they strayed away
Now that's what I call hard times
I rather be here to exercise the mind
Then I take a thought around the world twice
From knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
Across the desert, that's hot as the arabian
But they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asian
Reaching for the city of Mecca, visit Medina
Visions of Neffertiti then I seen a
Mind keeps traveling, I'll be back after I
Stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa
Return the thought through the eye of a needle
For miles I thought and I just fought the people
Under the dark skies on a dark side
Not only there but right here's an apartheid
So now is the time for us to react
Take a trip through the mind and when you get back
Understand you're third eye seen all of that
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)
Even the (ghetto)

No more props, I want property in every borough,
Nobody's stopping me because I'm thorough,
Rhymes I make gimme real estate for me to own
Wherever I bless a microphone
007 is back and relaxing
On point and reactin' and ready for action
I'm so low key that you might not see me
Incognito and taking it easy
Quiet, it's kept on a hush hush
In front of a crowd, I get loud, there's a bumrush
Be calm, keep a low pro and play the background
Hopin' the wack rapper put the mic back down
So rip it, break it in half, go 'head and slam it
'Cause when it's time to build, I'm a mechanic
I'm bonding and mending, attaching and blending
So many solos, there is no ending
People in my neighborhood, they know I'm good
From London to Hollywood, wherever I stood
Footprints remain on stage ever since
As I walk the street, I leave fossils and dents
When I had sex, I left my name on necks
My trademark was left throughout the projects
I used to get rich when I played celo
When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go we know
So I collect my cash then slide
I got my back, my gun's on my side
It shouldn't have to be like that

Z-Ro:
I used to set up shop 'about 6:00 in the morning on my grind
Powder packs and crack and nerve sacks out of the ghetto was on my mind
Needed to relocate with the thought of location, keepin' it on the low
'Cause when niggas see you all the time it seems they act friends just to get your dough
But it ain't no raw to me
I ride with the armory, the AR15
Collectin' my digits and spinnin' my tires, no time for conversation, I gotta ride
Back to my safe place, stash spot for the waste plate
'Cause I'm a go getter, if the game escapes ballin' was the picture 'cause there was no hitter
Niggas is sinnin' major, nothin' but home runs when I swing my bat
But some of these niggas be playin' crooked so I can't forget to bring my ghat
But when it's all said and done I'm a redo my walls with platinum placks
At the Source Awards, with a grand daddy
Couple of drinks, straight like that.

I'm movin' my units, I'm movin' my heart it's all for stacks man
And once I get it, it ain't gon' be no turnin' back
Fuck the boomerang affect makin' muthafuckers hate me from a distance
Hoppin' fences in an instant
Tryin' to get away from the long arm of the law
Jeopardize my Benjamin's, I will be forced to put some harm on your jaw
My attitude be raisin' it's amazin' I'm not locked for man slaughter
Because I love my plastic princess & I can't keep my hands off her
She be right next to my nuts every time I deal with hoes and crews
Send my bitch to fuckin' suck it bitch, before I know they move.
Is that gangster enough for you baby? Ro gotta get his dough bro
Bendin' corners in a tinted out 4 do' Volvo blowin' dro hoe.

Death Blow,Kool Moe Dee,Rap,"To the Break of dawn
To the, to the, to the
Times up punk
Yeah yeah Time to settle the score
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go

Here we go, beat down round 2
Heads up punk 'cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn, beats nitro
Lyrics weak, say goodnight 'cho
Star Trek shades, man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, g
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E, you're ridin' me,
T-O-D-D, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it, yeah, finish, burp
Now let a real man go to work
'Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics wit rabies
Cut ya like a knife 'cause you're nothin' but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow

Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain is fatigued, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears, or violins
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin'
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy

Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here"
I Changed My Mind (DJ Spinna Remix),Lyrics Born,Rap,"Well I came into a young boy girl with no experience
And here in here out, we had our ups and downs
But I always took it serious
I made the jokes, I played the fool
I took time made all the plans
I know I told ya that we were supposed ta have something booked for this weekend
But I changed my mind

I changed my mind, I changed my mind, I changed my mind
And I changed my mind

Well it started getting cosy girl
I let you control the reigns
And despite what I knew to be true
Well I'd hoped that things would changed
I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I hesitate 'cause of our situations
In retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action
But I just let it whiz on by
People say help me it's going a wry
And I'd flip out and say that's not right
Now I see my shit's stacked high
And I changed my mind

I changed my mind, I changed my mind, I changed my mind
And I changed my mind

Well looking back now as a young man girl
In hindsight I've been blessed
I never listened to my better judgement so my blind sight got the best of me
But we'd live and learn what you did in turn
Make me never ever settle for less
And what I deserve and once you mature girl
You'll always be second best

I changed my mind, I changed my mind, I changed my mind
And I changed my mind

It really pains me to see things change
But your limitations would of held me back
The things you say, try to under rate me
They were just a reflection of your self-respect
But now I let it whiz on by
Can't tell me hell me can't fly
Kiss my wings you can't me hypnotise me
Hear the MC a saying this bye bye
I changed my mind
Bout this here relationship that you've become so complacent
I've changed my mind you'd sacrifice everything we had
For a low price
I changed my mind, plain and simple
Now take me ????? girl
Changed my mind I tried, I kept it quiet
But now why the hell d'ya want to go and hypnotise"
Breakin' Dawn,Brother Ali,Rap,"Hmm, ha, ha, ha
Hey, hey, hey
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, hey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

Old master had a leper for a child
Left him out to fend for hisself in the wild
They laughed at him anytime he went to town
So he kept to his self and he seldom came around

Loved life and he loved his kin
But he couldn't understand why they ain't love him
Slept out in the shed all alone
And all he ever wanted was some friends of his own

A few hands saved him, took him in and raised him
Taught him about love and struggle and patience
Gave him the family comfort he was cravin'
He worked when they work and he sang when they sang

He sang so clear, so loud
That the masters of the children could hear him from the house
They recognize his voice and ran out
Everybody wanna know what the ruckus all about y'all, child

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way
Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day

Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, hey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

See good Lord, I've been waitin so long
For y'all to come out here and take me in the home
The world's so cold with no place to belong
They said, ""Come on in boy, sing your song.""

He stepped inside and to his surprise
It was so damn fly, he can't believe his eyes
Ate and he drank and he felt satisfied
'Til he sat by the window and he glanced outside

Loved ones out workin'
Eyes got full and his heart start hurtin'
'Cause them folk been singin' for years
But ain't any one of them set foot up in here

Hold up, how you get so much
Livin' off folk like us that got it so rough
The way you hold 'em in your cold clutch
Makes me think that you don't love your own soul enough

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way
Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way
Them songs of yours give us a brand new day

(Another day), ha
Hey, hey, hey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

Closed his eyes as he sang every note
The songs he was taught and the ones that he wrote
Stood up, cleared his throat, grabbed his coat
In those last moments, a few words were spoke

""I used to peak at this old house in awe
Imaginin' what it must be like and all
And this the finest spread these eyes ever saw
But I don't mind sayin I feel sorry for y'all

All that gettin', so little givin'
Led a lot of y'all to forget what's missin'
Built you a big pretty prison to sit in
Strut around here, convinced that that's livin'
'
But we gonna keep on singin
Keep on solderin', keep on buildin'
Keep on teachin' and keep on listenin'
And keep, keepin' on, till the whole thing's different""

In the shed, the sun start to set
Said all his prayers and laid down his head
Everything said that he needed to say
And one of these mornings we'll wake up to a brand new

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way
Them songs of yours give us a brand new day

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say

Why U Mad At Me (Explicit Screwed Version),T.I.,Rap,"(T.I. Talking)
I got a question fo you hatin' ass niggaz out there, Ay
Why you mad at me, Ay
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
Sucka ass nigga why you mad at me

Remember late nights earn stripes servin' straight white
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the ""J"" need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Befo a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
'Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
Day right I'm recitein my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold sundays slow mondays hot Friday nights
Tuesday thursdays servin' whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggaz had no idea what my life was like
Befo the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

Is it 'cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me
Maybe 'cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me
Is it 'cause I kept it pimpin' and stayed down
Why you mad at me
Or is it 'cause I am the a town
Why you mad at me
Is cause you a lame and I'm a ""G""
Why you mad at me
Is it 'cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me
Is cause you know yo time runnin' out
Why you mad at me
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south

Niggaz mad 'cause I got it like this


Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same tip till the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggaz in to me
Got little rap niggaz liking into me
Major lables and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass 'cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggaz who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't piture me
Ridein in a phatom and I swear I never favthom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from atlanta
Now I'm just tryin' to maintain for atlanta
Befo niggaz would say in atlanta
I was rhode park doug high stayed in atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in atlanta
But is that compared to contributions I made to atlanta

A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky I ain't buckin like I used to do fool
While you was throwin' one's and two's
I was liftin up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around 'cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowin' he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doin' the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smellin blow I ain't sellin
Where you got that impressin ain't no tellin'
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm sellin
I'm bankhead born and bankhead bread
And when a nigga die I'm gone be bankhead dead"
Just A Dog,Big Moe,Rap,"I was at the club one night (one night)
That's when I saw some hype (saw some hype)
She looked kinda thoed to me (she looked kinda thoed yeah)
She was all up in my grill (my grill)
So I showed her my big daddy steel (big daddy steel)
I'm just a dog, don't blame me (a dog don't blame me yeah)

(Big Moe)
Rolling on a Sunday, with the top down
Hit that M-L-K, popped up show some round
Headed to a bitch, that I knew from way back
She use to be skinny, but know that ass ain't flat
She said Moe-Yo, I didn't know that you rap
I remember you singing, way back at the Jack
Race in a Delta 88, scraping plates
All up and down 2-88 (8-8)
I Said, girl you remember that shit
Me, Herms Tooley, keep it with the hitting licks
Use to have boys sick, we use to skip school
Acting a damn fool, at Gravestone and Tenshoe
It use to be you, Kiesha, Bridget and Tanesha
And your whole damn crew
Tell me what it do, are we clubbing tonight
Maxo sound thoed, Yeah we thugging tonight, iight

(Big Moe)
I jumped in the gator, leaving the South Park
On the way to the crib, it was almost dark
You know a big dude, gotta hop up in the shower
I jumped up fresh, and jumped out clean
Hit the fo' for green, hit the stash for the lean
Grabbed my bling bling, screwed up around my neck
Grabbed a teck, for them boys who failed to respect
And the ones with the plex, you will get your days darkened
So move around, and watch me hit the lot without even parkin

Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh

(Big Moe)
Pulled up on the lot, just finished off a sweet
Dropped a hot twenty, valeted the SUV
Long line at the club, it's going down they made us back
But the big boss playa, gon pa-pass all that
That's when I noticed, you and your crew
Screaming Big Moe, can we come in with you
Hell yeah you want a G, V.I.P.
They got the whole section, roped off just for me
That's when your friends, started eyeballing me
Like she was fascinated, with the Barre Baby
One thing led to the next, it's a bit of some sex
I know I met you first, didn't mean to disrespect
But me and baby girl, had a chemistry
And I know you heard, of my history
Big Moe dog, ain't lazy with the law
I'm a lover dude, I can serve both of y'all

Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-hey-heeeey-yeah

Say Now,Nelly,Rap,"(Nelly)
(Look out!)
Gun shots rang out over the city
And had everybody duckin' and runnin', checkin' for any
Kinda shelter cause them peoples man they at it again
If you ain't heard or seen it then you better pretend
Ain't got no time for stoppin', ain't no catchin' your wind, ya
Baby mammas on the porch tellin' their daughters ""Come in!""
Got fathers grabbin' sons ""Where the hell have you been boy?""
And y'all they startin young I'm talkin' 13 and 10
They started trainin' in the streets some type of ghetto battles
But they ain't hoopin in no gym they hoop on crates in the alleys
Where else can you shoot a jump shot
Sling a rock all from the same spot?
Got one gang on this half the other gang
On the other half of the same block
Gunplay on Monday
Sundays a fun day
When will it stop?
One day?
Hell, I can't call it

When I come down to state dirty why you mad at me?
Is it cause the old school freaked out niggas from A to Z?
Eight CD's, TV's, I aim to please
They mean the same to me like Biggie to C's
Like Easy to E's, Tupac to overseas
And I done seen more Aaliyah fans fall cry to their knees
I tell ya, I ain't been livin' this life for too long
And I can't count how many times someone has asked me what's wrong
Why my mother was gone
Why my dady wasn't home
And the same shit they told me I find myself tellin' my own
Now its good-bye bad nights
Hello good times

The Night Before,Murs,Rap,"Now some claim gangsta rap's the CNN of the streets
But it's used as an excuse to pretend over beats
So I'ma lend my speech to all within my reach
To tell what really goes on from cells to the streets
Now in LA as you know there's a war going on
And it's been going on since before I was born
Though the undisputed origin has yet to be formed
It all used to boil down to the red and the blue
But that got fucked up as the many led the few
Now there's bloods killin' bloods and crips killin' crips
That's niggas killin' niggas they play kickball with
It ain't as simple as it was way back in '86
Let me give an example of some ol' MURS shit
My sect of mid-city is livin' on the edge
'Cause there's four gangs at war and none of them wear red
Any new car or face could mean bloodshed
Which led to the other night, I'm in my girl's Bug, right
I'm bout to hit the block to see who's chillin' on the spot outside
When I put it in park, the homey got a SK aimed at my ride
So I step out slowly, 'body no one fear
He yells, that's Murs I see his beard from here
But I told this whole story just to make things clear
So it don't seem weird when I tell ya this here

Last night I almost got shot on my block
Not the block where I live at, the block where I chill at
Where I keep it real at, and used to pack steel
At times I feel it's the spot I'll get killed at

Now in the entertainment industry they have sweeps weeks
But it's Thursday in my hood when they sweep them streets
A whole fleet of the task that they simply call CRASH
That's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums
If anyone should ask what the acronym reflects
Put into effect to try to keep the gangs in check
Now they're just another gang out bangin' they set
Known for stirring up some shit when your hood is at peace
The only pig I know dying to create beef
But let me get on with my story so that all of y'all can peep
Once again I'm on my block right, known as Cloverdale
Playin' 2K2 while I'm talkin' on my cell well
While I'm inside eyes glued to the screen
CRASH rolls on my homies with the Thursday routine
What's your name, where you goin', where you been, where you from
We say the same thing while they just play dumb
We don't gang-bang we got J-O-B's
Still they make 'em turn around and get down on they knees
Me, I'm screamin' in the house I just won by three
So when I run out on the porch to tell the homies come and see
I see 'em on the ground and I'm like, god damn
Plus I got this black Nextel phone in my hand
They both yell freeze, guns aimed at me
And even though I drop my phone it's plain to see

It was a 2 month tour that ended in Japan
So the first day back I had to spend it with my fam
That night I was goin' down to holler at my folks
Have a few beers, smoke, and share a few jokes so
To the block I bail but when I got to the dale
Everybody's on the porch lookin' distraught as hell
They start to tell me on how some fools from the other side
Just tried to kill T, he don't fuck with nobody
Just be mindin' his biz
So you have to understand what an explosive situation this Terry thing is
My nigga never gang-banged a day in his life so
Fuckin' with him is not a way to earn stripes
But a way to get wiped off the motherfuckin' planet
I don't claim to be a killer with a heart made of granite
But try to kill my best friend and it's on goddammit
I had the big homey roll me over to my place
So I could pick up this nine I kept just in case
Of some shit like this, a box of hollow-tips
I slipped back to the block with the heat in my hand
We sat up in the house loadin' guns, makin' plans
They asked me was it stolen, and why I never told 'em
Nobody in the hood ever knew that I was holdin'
I told 'em I forgot but I did it on purpose
So they wouldn't ask to borrow it to go and do dirt with
Now we locked and loaded and about to hit the streets
When we look to the corner there's a Jeep tryin' to creep
With its headlights off, we all leap for cover
They start to let off - now how does this sound?
When I hit the deck, my pistol hits the ground
So the homey picked it up and let off a couple rounds
After that went down I knew I might get clowned
So I shook to the crib to take a shower and lay down
The next morning woke up, rolled out of bed
I called my girl up and this is what I said"
The Show Must Go On,Insane Clown Posse,Rap,"Awwwwwwwwww,
Shit Yo,
Check it out, man,
ICP back in the house man!
Violent J, man,
2 Dope, man,
Wicked clowns, man.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, quick, hurry up, bang.
Open your mouth cause here comes my wang.
I'm Violent J, the southwest skitzo.
Born in a big top magical majisto
Dead body disco rappin' to the hoochies.
Dirty old fat hoe's come up with a smoochie.
Hoochie coochie, la la la la la.
I might pull your tongue out your mouth and try to hang ya.
It's a full moon and the riddles are calling.
Three more cards and the skies will be falling.
But don't take it from me, I'm just a clown.
Wicked clown, wicked town, Juggalugagaluga and lick it down
And up till my nuts start singing,
Dancing, hopping I'ma keep bringing
Riddles and tricks
And dead body chicks
With the swing of my magical wand,
The show must go on.
""Well, it all began when I was very young.
My feelings were so excited about the carnival rides.
Everyone was jolly and jittery.
I waited for their wagon until well after dusk.
That night, while I was sleeping,
I was awoken by a cold eerie wind.
And, looking out, I saw strange men,
Cursing and filthy, and there were clowns,
Setting up their dreary tent.""
I'm 2 dope and I sport tight wranglers.
Don't say a word or I'll kick ya in the neck bitch.
Everybody round, make way for the clown,
In New York, in LA, in southwest town.
Walked into El Rays, almost got my ass kicked.
Rather just chill in the yard in my casket.
Call up the hoe's have 'em swing by the tomb,
And get a little stinky stank up in this bitch.
Killer clowns kicked out the circus.
Used to get loud let the midget ladies work this.
I was a freak show,
They called me the pogo.
I can make my ballsack bob like a yoyo.
""Give it up! Give it up!""
Southwest looney tune,
Killed another red neck found his head in looney dune,
Gooney boon,
Gooney goon,
I can hear the loons in my head as I sing my wicked song.
The Show Must Go On.
""I've never been afraid of clowns but these clowns were different.
There was nothing funny about these clowns at that.
The smiled, they juggled, they laughed,
But yet something was terribly, terribly, wrong.
I didn't like these clowns for I could see through them,
I knew what they were really like.
I knew that this carnival that had come to my village was an evil,
Evil thing.""

Come see the show,
Big top show,
Walk hand in hand with the dead carnival.
Dead dirty carney, carnies,
Dead juggalos.
Walk hand in hand with the dead carnival.

You ask do we gangbang,
Do we bang in a gang,
Do we bang-bang?
I'm a gang banger, man!
I bang in a gang, mang.
You can suck my wang, mang.
Richie-boy, bitchie-boy, it's a southwest thing.
Serial murderer, southwest maniac,
Slaughterer, lunatic, highschool brainiac,
Straight A school boy, School kid '
Till I went to school and tried to murder everyone,
The Show Must Go On.
""My innocent friends were fools, all of them.
Totally unaware of the evilness within the clowns.
Their eyes reflected stairways into hell,
Their faces covered in blood.
I ran from the carnival grounds and yet every road
And every path lead me right back to the big tent.
I had to escape from the strongman,
The freak shows, and the Ringmaster...""
Heh heh heh heh!
Hah hah hah hah hah!

Crawlspace,Beastie Boys,Rap,"There's a party going on in here for real
I got more product than Ron Popeil
So deal with that troop, we're troopers
The only air time you get is on Bloopers

Beatsie Boys in the place, up in the space
So renovate or evacuate
You better think twice before you start flossing
I been in your bathroom often

Taking punk MC's out, I'm all about
My to do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here no room to breathe
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep

No I'm not Herman Munster nor Dr. Spock
I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
So here's a match my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you dog
I'm in your crawlspace

You're in front of my house and you know that's whack
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay you like Vader sip you for a first course

Don't even get me started on the intercourse...
AHHHHH!!
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery

The way you act a fool son you can't erase
And you're running on your way like a steeple chase
You tried to take my title put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace

Stealing my style from my trophy case
But my drive's secure like on an army base
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
You ain't never gonna catch me;
I'm in your crawl space

Schematics, blueprints and microfilm
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
'Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
And this extends beyond the Tri-State area

Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shawl?

'Cause these rhymes are 200 proof
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
'Cause were not buying what you're selling

First you want to battle then you start to whine
You're looking hungry, it must be snack time
So run home where you feel safe
But don't sleep Cochise;
I'm in your crawlspace"

Buckin my horse, giddy up, hey yo, hey
Buckin my horse, giddy up, hey yo

(Verso 1:)

I got more bass than a little bit
Game don't quit, my clique got a gang of them chips
And it don't stop, cause a brother went pop
And I got a couple knots in my sock
One dough, one glock
And I got me a cutie, buckin this 1992 dually
Will I come booty, who me
I thought you knew me
You come to the boulevard newly
Take a look at this truck, got 'em sittin' on stuck
Drop down to the ground, with them big sounds
Four twelves in the back, till the windshield cracks
Like that, with a fat bass track
And I love my horsey, try to ignore me
Scratch my back and you'll force me to dump
Dump, dump, dump, put 'em on stun
And drive my horse into the sun

(Break - woman talking)
Hey, what you say fool?
Nah, let me explain somethin' to you
This is my vehicle, you know what I'm sayin'?
I roll when I wanna roll
When I want 'cause I got my cabbage like that
You know what I'm sayin'?
Keep player hatin' and watch the ass drop
Car door slams and tires skid

(Verso 2:)

I gotta get an impala, pina colada
White cause the gold one's nada
Get the coke white seats, fill 'em up with heat
Six three with the bows on feet
Peanut butter top to match the guts
Droppin' that butt, got 'em all sayin' ""what!""
Yellow back with a profile, what's up now
Gotta give me ten points on style
And the paint ain't trippin', drippin
Look at this dippin, never caught slippin or missin'
And in case you was doubtin my pimpin' (what up fool)
My kitten, got the pearl white scopes to match my paint coat
Giddy up, here we go
Back to the boulevard, rush with the horse to the test
I'ma park this next to the best
And flex like I'm poster, rollin' this roaster
Hoein this holster, closer
'Cause I'ma boaster, roaster, red light toaster
No remorse when I buck this horse

(Female voice: let's take it from the east to the west homes)

Buckin my horse, giddy up, westside

Buckin this horse like a baller, black top slaughter
Makin' these eighteen's holler
In a brand new horsie, call it my porschey
Lookin' hella fly and bossy
Sittin' at a red light waitin, porsche's shakin
Talkin' more mess than payton
And I got it in first, gettin' ready for the worst
One point two turbo burst
Let it ride like a black tech
Bettin I'm gettin' my sex while I'm passin up bets
Grab my horse by the reins and tame it
Watch where I aim it, so I don't flame it
I can't explain the insane left lane
Swing to the right, it's pain
Pass these busters, lookin' like lusters
Sittin' three deep in a dark blue duster
Now I'm sittin' on cruise tryna get my food
Exit number 102 and then po-po spots me
The guys still watch me, big man needs teriyaki
I ain't trippin' on vandals
Cause my white gamballa has no door handles
Gotta get met with force
If you touch my ... horse

It's Yourz,Wu-Tang Clan,Rap,"Verse One: Raekwon the Chef

Machine gun rap for all my niggaz in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flashback
See through yellow lines
Rock a fly jersey in the summertime God
Magic marker rap, bleed benadine
Relaxed, wrote this, comin' at cha crab ass cope
And snatch ya ice off, chillin' in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feelin' like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
Melodic single, dark snap a nigga just like fish
You fucked up, some rich niggaz you done test yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggaz pulled up your dress
Style molest that, canal chain nigga where ya vest at
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussein niggaz light the torch, we flamin niggaz
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggaz

(All) It's Yourz!
(RZA) The world in the palm of your hand
(All) It's Yourz!
(RZA) Twenty-three million of useful land
(All) It's Yourz!
(RZA) The seed and the black wo-man
(All) It's Yourz!
(RZA) Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(All) It's Yourz! (2X)

Verse Two: U-God

Yo, super freak physique. like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, now I ride with my swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lah smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble Ark builders God rush
Beams of light, stop ya breathin -- it's hunting season
Honey eye-ballin down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws, cause tonight
(All) It's Yourz

Verse Three: RZA

Stop the fader of the RAM, pass my watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blam
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag -- off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands -- bitch, the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number Four the Lizard
Enchant a few solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Yahoo McDaniels
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

Verse Four: Inspectah Deck

It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact'll blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the Crooked I
No surprise, verbal stick up -- put 'em high
Rebel I, outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit, like bricks of C4

Verse Five: Ghostface Killah

Check out my beaver, baby blue glock in the safe
Seems Darthy and the God and get ski roll weight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smokin' estates, rhyme and power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court
For your birthday, the babyface of rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks rock the ""W"" in Spiegel books
Anheuser Busch kings came through, and stopped your whole jooks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room sheisty girl
Love to sit out this song, now watch your water break

Dying To Stay,Alias,Rap,"Initial thought: turn it up a notch from the regular
Capture feelings I convey and hold them tight for five minutes
Within this voice is a being who seeks understanding
Planning for a future of prosperity
I went from hating everything to enjoying most
And all it took was transferring to another coast
I'm a transplant transforming opinions and transferring thoughts
I brought along a little friend called emotion, he's everything they're not
I mean, hey, I try my best to put a bug in the ears of the blind
Then again, I had to figure all this out on my own
I owe this much to myself
This if for the wealth I'll never see but I'll never be alone
I recall never getting this feeling the entire year
And all it took was a stumble and pushing some squares
Unaware of creations held within
I'm crawling through it all to find a place to rest
Begin the process of scabbing over with no picking
Reopening wounds leads to infections. Therapy is practiced weekly
Pass the papyrus and inkwell to compose the thoughts
To convey, to jack open closed engines
Complex perplexing questions repeated
Give a canned response yet again
I'd rather roll around in the Paper Patch
Monumental memories from before my insides were forced to hatch
And come into themselves: a mean case of motion sickness
I'm trying to disperse the sensation I received too many years ago
With the slickness of muddy basslines
Why? When I'll have no responsibilities to someone else's cause
I wouldn't mind applause for welding words in a non-existent scheme
Why question anyone else's actions?
Continue worrying about my own and doing as I see fit
Feelings speak louder than both actions and words combined
Trying to find a way to get that candle relit and... uh

Here I am, where it ended last time
Starting point ending first just like the frame before
The graininess softens the entire scene
Prompting urges to put on my coat and pass through that door
But... uh... I'm dying to stay

Stuck in these four walls dying of heat and happiness, professing my feelings
This is closure for the masses
I love the smell of musty records and I'm sickened by spring break
Another reason I developed my own education
Imagine if everyone could be themselves
Today, I walked against the herd and chuckled
'Cause I found it quite ironic
Oh, what a feeling to break the chains of writer's block. Upbeat requirement
There's an ounce of ""I can't stand you"" that I keep in reserves:
Break the glass in case of emergency
Urgent message: ""You've lost the pattern!""
I'm not deaf, I'm ignoring you flooring the naysayers for entertainment
""Yo, this track is funky!"" You quiet down
I'm only allowed to do depressing songs that worry Jenn
But I must admit this feels really good
I can make you cry without laughter instead of just crying
So I'll continue cradling my pen
I've gone an entire album without excessive slang, so let's ruin that:
""Phat! Phunky! Phresh! Def! Cold chillin' in effect
It's off the meat hook! Yo, this jawn is fly!""
Now that I've dumbed it down
Will you pass me your acceptance to put in my sack?
Mine is the one that says ""Bad MamaJama""
This collection of random thoughts was brought to you today
By being sent home early and was also sponsored
By newfound inspiration and eagerness
I hope you enjoyed the show... and... uh"
Carry The Weight,Xzibit,Rap,"Intro: Xzibit, (J-Ro)

I really wish I could you know at twenty-one
YouknowhatI'msayin', he he, yo yo
(I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things
I do, youknowhatI'm sayin')
Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin'
Go ahead
Yeah! I break it down like this

Verse One:

You see I don't like to remenisce about the past
The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth
Each and every wrong move the police keep count
Make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out
I was at the funeral when it all began
You know the painful transition from a boy to men
I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine
Didn't understand death nearly lost my mind
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it
Age ten, new step family arrangement
At thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit
I would forever be hit with anything in reach
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach
About forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked
Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked
Physical contact was in form of a slap
At the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back
Courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate
I don't remember the date of the judicial debate
But legally I was now in custody of the state

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight

Interlude: Xzibit, (J-Ro)

(Yeah it's fucked up though man)
(YouknowhatI'msayin')
Yo
(The fuck you doin' in jail)
Insane man, I don't know man, he he he
(Yeah wats goin' on down there, gotta get out dude)
Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man
YouknowI'msayin'
(It's popin' man)
It's cool yo fuck that
(It's popin' out here)
They can go on and on for that
(I'm tellin' you it's popin' man come home)

Verse Two:

And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home
But only now I was fucked up plus all alone
My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone
Turned age sixteen now on my own
Started running with cats who carried gats 'cause they had too
With no hesitation lock load then blast you
Without a hastle we in a town of hicks
Fuckin' all these chicks
Sellin' rock by the bricks
So we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown
At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down
Screamin' demands ""Let me see your goddamn hands (now)""
A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban
We never kept it in the house
So of course we clounded
Only found one pistol took us all down town
We be out by the end of the afternoon
Gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM!
Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife
Ty and Matt caught bodies
Now they spend there life behind bars
Catchin' scars that will not heal
Niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real

Like this
Like this, like that
Yeah! gotta carry the weight
Like this euh!
Bringin' live
Yeah! yeah! like this
It's Xzibit
Gotta carry the weight
Like that yo!
Like that yo!"
Dues,Cipher,Rap,"Payin' dues -Group Home

My point of views through payin' dues
Using microphones set it off like the fuse in the Cipher zone
As I'm tellin' crews be gellin'
Rhymes blow your outter skeleton if your styles relevant
You know the flavor I gets deep like the grave
Headcracks I gave when tomahawk like a Brave
Now I'm paid in the trade like Special Ed Got It Made
Some conquer slave along the way sprayed like Raid
In 92 I spent my days in the YMCA
Freestyling while I cut the cross fade like a blade
Stayed off the stage writting page after page
Now I blast like a gauge twisting raps like braids
Laid stunts like I forgot, blunts got me all high
Hittin' stick after stick as I kick back
Acting like you run shit, rappin' all that dumb shit
You ain't the first one to brag about your fuckin' guns kid
Uzis and toolies they just don't impress
Whoole under the best bless let's my brain arrest stress
And that's the test act like you got a clue
If you're new on the set don't forget to pay dues

""I pay dues"" ""We work hard"" ""Payin' dues""
(Guru] ""I pay my dues and shit"" [x4)

Now I'm on the come up no need to run up with your gun up
From sun up to sun down I run sounds
The rap race is mad fucked up
MC's act stuck up but get they cars plugged 'cause they shit is butt
I bust rough cuts and never trust promoters at a show
They stack doe and try to stake me off the cash flow
Assholes be like ""Yo know you got's to pay dues""
Fuck that I slay crews since days of 1982
You could never catch me empty handed at the mic stance
Understand I'm fed flippin' like tails and head
Born dead of the coffin known for droppin' non stoppin' schemes
Hit your spleen box and leave you fiendin' for oxygen
Rockin' 'em in Boston cause yo we ain't soft when I blow spots off
Then step collect my props and be out with the skins or punany
Styles get deeper split the beaver
Hit the cheeba sip a liter of Tequila
I need a break gettin' tired of makin' demo tapes
Wating for papes fills my mind state with hate
I create since the days of the Cameo fame
So don't come running up askin' about the dues I've paid"

Everytime you try to do what you can
To get the ass, it's part of the plan
You settin it up, you buyin her stuff
You do it for the love cause you bucklin up
MacNicholas, Muh-Fuck ready to,

Plus to tell the truth y'all
It's been a long time, this chick got me settin up the abbeyance
If you ask me, yo it's time to get down
I turn up the music, get some bass in my sound
Quick dash to the bathroom cologne me down
Now, it's time to relax
Back on the scene that's, MackNicholas mack
Tell her the place to be is the place where she's at
She's feelin' relaxed, my hands on her,
I'm feelin' up this chick I'm feelin' up her flap jacks
Got a page from her girl said let me call Sha ne' back

Much more than just one could do

Told Cock Block he could hop many women
Upon them never ever release your semen
Upon them is a materialized demon
Illustrious, succubus, do not trust
She see you when you coming
She know you wanna bust
Now she got you sippin on the clitorus, juice

Kid Capri, Flex, S, Clue or Biz
It is off the lid, spot's type crazy
Cats up in here got more bling than Baby

The type to rebound with chicks I'm not Rodman
I gotta girl with a butt big as Trina's
And green eyes but mine are greener
(I'm Hot) I keep it simple like add and subtract
One color, everything I rock is black
Like that black chic black whips
Black annex car brand new never ran it

I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooh

1 Am... pandemonium
Song comes on Ja Rule and Lil Mo and 'em
So hot the spot's outragious
It's Ron and Kelly Chante contagious

My words are being relayed who's sayin' 'em?
Ay yo! we are
My name's drama that's why it starts with ER
(I'm Hot) I'm by far the best stop the racket
I'm a master with a mic and green jacket
They can be the traffic write somethin' and run it
Add a hot boy threw with me and stun it

I'll smash outlast your best MC
Make him trash that CD, crash that seat
Head bang through the window when he heard the E

Street Struck,Big L,Rap,"(Big L)
Yeah, it's the Big L
Comin' at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown... and everywhere
Check it!

Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
Cause mad clowns be catchin wreck with a tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up witchu in the long run
Brothers be all up on us, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
They life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got TALENT; but they'd rather sell cracks
And bust gats and run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin skinz and makin' some easy green
Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (WHAT?) 'cause they street struck

Chorus: Big L

You betta listen when L rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
Get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
Get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time

(Big L)
Before the rap contract, I was sellin crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into alla that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game sellin 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that, if you're dead, or behind bars?
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Aiyyo they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave 'em up 'cause they street struck

Chorus: repeat 2X

(Big L)
I still chill with my peeps in the streets; but most of the time
I'm in the crib, writin rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin me, like the crack be callin Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from -- you can choke from the gunsmoke
Stay off the corners; that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin on a hospital bed, from bein street struck

Chorus: repeat 2X

(Big L)
Worrrd up!
Aiyyo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, youknowhatI'msayin?
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the cats teasin streets
I'm outta here"

(Warren G)
This DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while he go round
To the Hip to the Hop you just don't stop
Producing funky tracks till it makes you drop
Conjunction junction, what's my function
I'm hookin up tracks so that niggaz can function
It's not Pete Rock or that nigga Dr. Dre
It's this muthafuckin nigga from around the way
The one who brings you styles on timesy, whymsy
That's why it's so hard to find me
Conduction, construction when I bust choo choo, bustas
It's a must when I bust when I bust, I gotta come correct
The R to the E to the S-P-etc architect
Yup nigga no I'm not tweakin
Its one of the 16 minds that I'm speaking
The W-A the double R the E into the uh
A-B-C-D-E-F to the muthafuckin G
Ooh shit as I flex I wrecks I checks
So what's next

(Mr. Malik)
Oh who's next, to catch flack on the menu
I snap necks when I flex let me continue
Send you, on a mission when I rock
It goes on and on and on and you know it don't stop
Yes I'm back on another route, ready to take 'em all out
Now can't get with this, 'cause they get faded without a doubt
Check em, I wreck 'em like 1-2-3 why
They can't fuck with that rude one Malik
Will I drop, can't stop it, lit it up like a rocket
When they get out of line I grip the nine out my pocket
Lock it down, yeah that's what I do
How could you come solo nigga when I run through ya whole crew
I rule, fool, act like you heard it
The one I run with, can't remember the last he murdered
Dem do away or them get dealt with
Give the noise I want silence, no bubbaclad bullshit
Nigga, it's all about my grip
So the one who starts to slip is the one who gets ripped
Kept a chip on my shoulder not now that I'm older
They, all of me, the LBG high roller
'Cause back in the days on the side where we sat
Niggaz a come up missin' if they didn't have they strap
So why, try to be, like me
Just when you pull back a G and I think I'm Mr. Malik

Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
We spark in the dark when we do it in the park

(Mr. Malik)
Well it's the A to the B
(And the C to the D)
Hey my name is Mr. Malik with that DJ Warren G
(Mr. Malik can you hear me)
Yes I'm the host with the most they can't get close or even near me
(I said a tick, tock, tickin to the Era)
I said a pick which glock bitches get shot its still terror
(Terror, terror, pick which glock)
Which one? (the black one with the big pin lock)
Me and Dre and the fly honey so those who wanna get dropped
Nigga go knock, knock I trick a flow non-stop
Fly double I never slip trip or flip flop
The tune is funkadelic, the crew was right
But if Malik will make ya smell it then tonight's the night
For me to stay trump tight
Up with my nigga Warren G
That's sorrow when you borrow but you can't be oweing me
What's next

Woo!
I say what's next, what's next what's N-X-E-T

Yes, it's me Warren G on the block
Pump pump, block glock, let me just tick tock

Yo, I put the pace down, recognize my fate now
I'm ILL, still freakin skills like H-Town
I disgrace clowns who make frowns
Smile in your face but hate and deliver fake pounds
I'm a animal, in a cannibal sector
With chicks that give you brains like Hannibal Lector
Peep logic - there's nothin' you can do to stop this
You have a better chance catchin bullets with chopsticks (WAHH!)
Wait for the avalanche - then you'll get down
Spit rounds, my sitcom's a full clip now
Murder shows, practiced and unrehearsed, dead on point
Like a convertible cactus hearse
It's mucus fluid, when I spit exclusive music
I believe in dirt, SO I DO IT STUPID
I move units, like {?} and white rose
My freestyle's ill - I'M DOPE WHEN I WRITE FLOWS

Put the sun in your face, make you walk a tightrope - and pose
I can't just rhyme, I can flow
F-f-flow, flow f-flow, f-f-flow, flow

(C-Rayz Walz)
I do somersaults with Silly Sally in Silicone Alley
Roll red carpets in darkness through Death Valley
And receive love (love) like Larry
I'm flowin black - it's September? Goin' back to Cali
To drink booze in the House of Blues
Doin' the JAMES, in Elvis Presley shoes
From the belly of BK, where the drama's at
All the way to Saudi Arabia - where the llamas at
Trapped in central bookings - for a chronic sack
Feelin' worse; I'm really here, for killin' a verse
Homicide comes to ask ""Who did it?""
I step to the next +Iron Galaxy+ like astral physics
I'm spiked with no sugar, natural image
Thirst is nothin', burst you for frontin at the scrimmage
Vampires suck, you stuck once bitten
Off the head I'm fed, my freestyle eats my written
I need that dollar like Chris Rock - just kiddin
I'm down to earth like sunlight, and alien visits
In the club with {?}, guzzlin water
Trainin my daughter to be a soldier, I taught her
To put six in your chest - like Julius Earving
Controllin the cypher, you foolishly swervin
I deserve to glow and now you know
AIYYO, I can't just rhyme, I can flow

Flow flow, flow {*repeat 3X*}

You know you fucked up, tellin' rumors on my crew
But fuck the dumb, you gotta estimate
Before you tell a lie on the 7-88, 88

And when he did it, you fronted on his ass when you did it
You won't admit it, yet you know you bullshitted
Yet you walk around town like your shit is sweet scented

And in a minute, niggaz intend us to get in it
I recommend this, estimate it
Don't false advertise us no need for pretendin
To be someone you're not when you can't hide your feelings

YOUR TRUE FEELINGS~! Cause you can't hide your true feelings
I get the feeling, you got devious intentions
Actin' like a Willie when you're just a Sir William

I looked out the window, seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot and he was caught out there

Saw the convertible driving by
Loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct with my egg gun

The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger I pulled, his face the yoke

Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with an egg mustache
Suckers they come a dime a dozen
When I say dozen, you know what I'm talking about, boy

(Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man)
(Driving around, King of the town ""Hey"")
(Always got my windows rolled down)
(Ready to throw)
(You know I'm the Egg Man)

Once upon a time
""Egg Man""

Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman, he said ""Bloodclot""

Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
I egged the chicken and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains in between cars
When I pull out the station, ""You're gonna get yours""

Drive-by eggings plaguing L.A.
""Yo, they just got my little cousin Ese""
Sometimes hard boiled, sometimes runny Ray
Comes from a chicken not a bunny, dummy

People laugh, it's no joke
My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yoke
""Now they got me in a cell"" but I don't care
It was then that I caught catching people out there

(Up on the roof, in my car, up all night)
(I'm going through science like Dolemite)
(The Mack (Who?))
(I'm the Egg Man, Taxi Driver)
(I'm the Egg Man)
""Egg Man Egg Man""

We all dressed in black
We snuck up around the back
We began to attack
The eggs did crack on Haze's back

Sam I Am, down with the program
Green Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween, you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker, k-pap

You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling

Families, punk rocks, the businessman
I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand
Not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead, here's a towel, now wipe

""Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man

What you know about my city that's tic tac?
Hustle to get stacks
Fail get laughed at
Even from here I hear the chit chat
Grew up Miracle Mile
Fairfax to tar traps, Hamilton High alumni
What you know Ham and cheese supreme
JB to Carthay cat LA it be the base and the catalyst
Walk Crescent Heights worldwide back to strangle us
Land of the saint and the land of the wicked
Hollywood to Bell
The manichean kick it
What a duality, arid reality
Devon Brown Shot
Minor technicality
Brad Pitt's cheatin' front page reality
Stanley Miller Beatin'
DA don't want to touch it
But I love my city
Soft yet rugged
Rep LA I know the Angels will love it

City of angels!

Jabu:
I let the beat talk
Then I just fill in the words
Its Jabulani that you're dealing with
My hood is tough like its clubber lang
So in the bucket I bump behind mac in the gutter lane
I write raps when I feel the pain or even sorrow
But you heard it before the sun will come out tomorrow, or so they say
But see we're living in L.A. and what you thought was the sun, was just a flash from the k
You stashing your weed in the passenger seat of the regal with the gold feet
Watch your back, lil' homie got a loaded mac on Figueroa
Just got a new girl
His rep he's finna show her
But slow down baby gangsta, you ain't prepared for the truth
You got him and it's gonna happen to you, ain't gotta live how your homie do
Just work the angles
The city I'm from is Los Angels
Come on!

Well you got a hot date and you wanna be fly
Throw on a Gucci blazer and a Gucci tie
Not a hair out of place, a freshly-shaved face
You think you're walkin' out the house with style and grace
(Don't you)
You pick up your girl and take her to dinner
'Cause when the night is over you think you're gonna win her
Then you move real close using all your charm
And then your girl says ""Baby guess that""

(I smell your underarms)

That odor, it's ringin' out loud and clear as a bell
You can't hear it because you're immune to the smell
I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic
Now I know that it's stone cold funk, I can tell
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell
That funk the aroma, that smell, that scent
You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent
Your odor going 'round, doin' people bodily harm
And then somebody turned around and said

(I smell your underarms)

You woke up late for work usin' the same old line
Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time
The more you ignore, the worse the smell grows
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose
It was the rush hour when I was on the train
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death
I couldn't hold a conversation, I was holding my breath
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air
Was homeboy sittin' next to me, I swear!
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming
(Ugh...)

(I smell your underarms)

Hanging at a party one night, all alone
Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon
The crowd was on the floor, rocking the beat
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week
The smell was all through the house, cold rockin' the place
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm
A girl said ""Look, there's Monster growin' under his arm""
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh)
And they declared his arm public enemy number one
Now throw your hands in the air, if you want to party hard
Now put your hands back down, everybody's,'cause
You didn't use Right Guard

(I smell your underarms)"
Reflections,Atmosphere,Rap,"(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

(Slug)
What would it take to make a women like you
View a wolf like me for what I really might be
Listening to the lyrics only here's what I allow
You gotta try and make me testify for here and right now
Lets have a confrontation over a cold one
I'll give you conversation just to see if you can hold em
I play so dumb
Because I know some of these star struck small talk art fucks is no fun
I'm the blood type that goes straight for the guns
Like before you even spoke already knew what your loves like
So what you thinking?
Because I'm thinking we should jump into your ocean
Let's go girl this ship is sinking

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

(Slug)
Now there's no reason to lie, I've had a lot of lovers
In my reality it's impossible to avoid it
But there's one reason for life gotta provide some supper
Gonna build a family just to watch some one destroy it
Do you really think you really wanna get to know me better
Don't you see the drama
Don't you feel the pressure
Don't get me wrong it would be my pleasure
To sing a song that could remove your shoes and your sweater
Bartender let me get a shot of Beam
Cause this girl over here is trying to get me out my jeans
And she doesn't seem to believe I'm just another thief
Came to take a piece and make you stutter when you breath

Now girl you're too smart to be a tour mark

Set the play correct from the start with your pure heart
And when you're all alone I'll sing into your phone
If you don't know the words you can make up your own

The first time she met the devil was at first avenue
Went back stage with him into the dressing room
Sexy ego trip
Taller than expected
About six foot three
Seemed to thrive on his misery
Critical, observant, big words
Sweaty hair, sunken eyes, and thick curves
She said I'll make him smile for the simple fact that he needs it
I'll make him smile just so I can kill it and eat it

You look like you were built for me
You talk like you want to steal my drink
You kiss like you already came
And that's a Lifter Puller line for those without any game

It's like damn baby
You know you can't save me
But you should still tell your people that you're leaving with the band
Maybe you can show me your hustle
Neither one of us would be so lonely
If only you would come over here and hold me
I caught you trying to hide your smile behind your glass
But all of your secrets become a swing set when you laugh
And all of your regrets that you're carrying a burying
Don't mean a damn thing if there's nobody to share them with

We've been following each other all night now
We ought to be all over each other like right now
I don't like crowds lets take flight now
Cause that face that you make
Reminds me of my life now

(Chorus: repeat 6X)
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

""Only trying to find myself inside of you"""
For My People,EPMD,Rap,"Hereeeeeee we go...

Verse One: Erick Sermon

The E-R-I-C-K S-E-R-M-O-N
I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10
More menace and I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash (yes) you ain't seen *shit* yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety, for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
'Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin
You should hope, that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin and bustin'
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shit's thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by USA and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Verse Two: PMD

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin necks, bustin' caps, and breakin jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
To whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in wrong camp, punk, stepped on a landmine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brentwood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some *bullshit* charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a tech nine
Yes the brother's back wit no knife or ax
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, wit guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel
For this *shit* I kick, it's strictly for my people

Unsafe Sextet/Gilded Hearts of Booklovers,Busdriver,Rap,"I frown upon the media blitzkrieg
When the sephia tint bleeds out of your sleezy club striptease
You give the cheesy club chick feed
Your reality TV stud misreads his scripted pig oinks
So I disjoint his measly thug prestige
When my wheezing lung is squeezed
Out of the pitiful entrapments of an able bodied squatter
I spew frothy fodder
From the tenuous underpinnings of a corroded mind
I can't learn a thing
Yet my creative furnishings are a body of water
So I'm a coffee potter
Yes I'm a barista at starbucks
You can lessen my financial woes
Just swipe your visa card once
Buy this explosive whoopee cushion
My loathsome pussyfooting should be put in
Runs with a pizza parlor runts want of arcade tokens
Join the styled fauna of the industry mixer and suffer mild trauma
I need a chemistry kit sir
And not to coddle pistol grips I only need one popsicle stick
For my boyz 'n' the hood diorama
Oh my band sucks shit
Were not first on no bills
We play sand buckets
And eat birth control pills
And my fingertips look like crisp fried ends
I go off
Diss my friends
Looking at the negative balance on my account through a fish eyed lens

You get some tap shoes and snorkles and bandmates
And sheet music with trombones and handguns
Unsafe sextet
We upstage the best yet and tongue bathe cassette decks
Holding unpaid rent checks
You get some piccolos and cutlery and thermoses
And fashionistas with jumpsuits and congos
And what do you got
Unsafe sextet

Gilded hearts of booklovers
And you decided to write the hip hop version of karma sutra
After being fired from your job for uprocking to close the water cooler
In the regalia of a star prick I measure our genitalia with a yardstick
And dethrone my third person drowning it in sea foam
And drink the blood from its wing nub dipping in it with cheese scone
Exchanging pelvic thrusts while pulling the elephant tusk from my cheekbone
Put my dirty feet in a pair of socks and my bird beak in a swear box
And unfasten my pants
Insure that my mojo crash lands on your happenstance
You're a flash in the pan
Quid pro quo with the newest thing to come out
With me its no go I'm a shooting range cut out
But my woodie's blair underwooden, you should book me with wonder women
I ain't go the suggested footwear but the kids leave the breakfast nook bare
When I prep fixins I'm hedging clipping their reading habits at the book fair
But I'm too pithy and far fetched to compete with your hickeyed guitar neck
I hear the political convictions of your depbut EP dwarf isclamfascism
Great news! you get rave reviews 5 out of 5
But this'll leave your noodle full blown this year were touring funeral homes
And that self serving agenda will buckle under the weight of these lengthy diatribes
And you decided to write the hip hop version of karma sutra
After being fired from your job for uprocking to close the water cooler
Oh your games so tough, it de magnetized my key card
It's so hot and fresh, your merch booth needs a sneeze guard
And I fall off without a tug on the ripchord
I amount to fuzz of the mixboard
But how can I get my game re-charged, tell me.

Oh gilded hearts of booklovers
You don't have to be careful let your hinged airhole swing ajar
We have disemboldened the cookie cutters
Who the fuck do they think they are

To give you a verse like, that first hit of extascy

And I want these sluts to love me, but if they don't then fuck 'em
'Cause tomorrow if they swallow, if they won't the I duck 'em

Kept it right here in the South and did it with a good ol' team
So hate it if you must, but I made it and you can trust

Took a shower at the dungeon, dried off and was still filthy

Probably chill till the time is right
Till I feel I need a man in my life
But for now Ima keep it tight
Till I burst under pressure when my temperature rise
I'm on the women's pride
Feel me right
So it's the ladies night

Guitar,Lady Sovereign,Rap,"If I could play guitar, then I'll play it,
But I can't so I'll just sing it, sing it

I wrote S-O-R-R-Y,
I'm tellin' you that,
And I don't know why,
Maybe because I was sky-high,
And thinking to much about my life.
So I turned off the light,
And I tried to rap,
But only bullshyt left my mind,
And most of the time I was fine,
But you're windin me up while I'm hard on my grime.
When were you born? 1985
Why didn't you finish school? Because I skied.
Step back, get back,
Comment on my face yeah,
I'm just tryin' to live my life.

I feel a little tired,
I feel like cryin,
I feel like lyin',
I feel like not tryin' to do
What I was supposed to do today.
(Fuk)

A couple of interviews,
A photo shoot,
A show to do,
Promote new tunes.
Oh I hate it when I feel this way,
Oh why do I feel this way?
Tell me...
Yesterday was a different story,
High and mighty,
Feeling glory.
Shut down time square,
Know that you saw me.
Felt enormus, like twenty stories.

Today of all days,
You try to rush me.
Hush puppy, let me do my thing,
I'm not your puppet on a string brov...

(Really?)

Now don't get me on,
You silly little punk.
Expect me to walk,
'Cause I'm not gonna run.
I wish life was as easy as playing the guitar,
Ya just pick it up and ya strum.

(Eeeh, maybe not)"
As The Rhyme Goes On,Eric B. & Rakim,Rap,"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
You sweat as you step about to get hype
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic
You're physically in this with me but how could you tell
If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored
If you just keep kickin' listen - to the mix
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
Holds and controls you till I leave
You fall deeper in the style - it's hard to breathe
The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then
Bring 'em to the front cause my rhymes' the oxygen
Then wave your hands - when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue
And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top - and I came to drop it
Catch it and quiz it - is my topic
Universual cause I move everybody to come
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get
I draw a crowd - like an architect
The five borroughs react and all the islands attract
And every state can't wait - so they attack
Off a spot on the floor - squeeze in 'cause it's packed
It'll be more room if MC's play the back
I'm the r the a to the k-i-m
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
The microphone fiend if I was a fake
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make
I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like

The voice on the record - I see what you mean
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream
So just - give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it
If not - into the crowd I'll throw it
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well
Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells
I took time to write - tonight I will recite
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin'
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin'
Home to tell a friend when the party ends
""Yo, man you know rakim? that brother struck again""
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage,
Tape by tape and page by page,
When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix
The rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets
Deeper and deeper - I hope you understand it
I made it up myself and I planned it
For other MC's who waste time
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme
I cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating
The rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking
They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'
To get up on the microphone and then start takin'
Control of the mic - uptight when I grabbed it
So hug the speaker- your ear's a magnet
Attracted to a freestyle put in effect
You listen to my man while you're sippin' moet
So eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight)
Give me a scratch, turn my mic up a little,
I want you to hear this perfectly clear
Catch what I'm sayin' you get the idea?
I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on..."
The Priziest Horse,Sole,Rap,"I'm not the priziest horse or the classiest fighter
With shattered glass in my voice
Writing my name on the wall with the fingers my highschool gave me; I'm still
Counting electric sheep at night, in love with an electric blanket
In fact I make love with electric outlets
In my sleep, it's all flying pigs and things that want me dead;
When I'm awake, it isn't much different. It's not them versus us
The battle wages over future addictions
Something's missing, and I can't quite focus on it
Oh, it must be the disappearing act we all put with our dreams
They'll never find me as long as I keep smudging off into the background
And continue to sink through the sidewalk with my head under a bench, to see
Who hears me, narrating their lives by the way they hold their money so tight
So they could send their kids off, but the best historians sleep on benches
(Why is everybody sleeping on benches?)
I've been a rock as long as I've lived
Since everything has to be a nobel prize winner
I should've quit when I saved the ozone
I should have known if I can't feel the ones I came with, it's a good time to rest
And hold fear at bay like some hold the margins they need to survive in
Barely alive, and you want me to lighten up?
Make an angel on the beach or pick a boquet in your garden
Call me when they drop redemption upon you like a piano
Record the noise it makes when it flattens your hands
Then you realize it was only a dream and you were tied to a tree the whole time
Watching friends drag by 'cause they can't look at the scars under your eyes
Burned to hell covered by locusts, they're trying to quote us
Now that they finally broke us into ridiculous names and meaningless titles
I won't forget, the little things escape
Through the pores in my skin so I can pour it on thick
And watch them scurry to escape the glass, leave the collection
And have a life of their own, well get rich you'll hate it too...
I promise...

In this life all I have, a falling sky in my arms
It's not that heavy, make pretend
It's someone else's party, what a gas

Shaking the hands that never trembles and always land on my feet
At this present elevation, I can't see past my feet
Between God's bald spots where the sky stops
I'm one of the Earth's latest gallstones
Despite all the America going on, it's all Rome
Go get unstuck, don't lose sleep till you can't find solace
In the fact that you can barely control yourself. Let alone
We're all tied down; since our wings got clipped, and lately can't sing enough
In the party that never ends, 'cause no one knows how to clean up the mess
What's up with all the gags?
Everyone around me has these holes drilled through 'em
And someone on the other side is trying to figure it out. Dying to be someone
Killing to be recognized as something that you're not
Well since we're all so into introductions, don't forget your names
Since you love yourself so much, keep it away from me
'Cause I've baked under artificial lights with artificial girls
And that sinking feeling there's someone sleeping inside my sleepless body
Quit playing kid games with your old tongue
Till you can find someone to buy future epiphanies from. Here's one:
I live in the city and leave everything alone, yesterday it was all TV
After all is said and done, we barely have memories
So I write what I feel, sue me if it's empty
Imagine that, I'm barely human, I'm barely human...

In this life all I have, a falling sky in my arms
It's not that heavy, make pretend
It's someone else's party, what a gas"
Hand On My NutsAC (LP Version),Coolio,Rap,"(I got my) I got my hand on my nutsac burnin 'cross the stage
In a motherfuckin rage like a animal in a cage
I catch wrecks like a junkyard fool (fool)
Fuck around and get'cha holdin' that jar, Cool!
Yep that's me on the motherfuckin mic-a (mic-a)
Nova, happy to strike niggas like a viper
Who rules the step to the rep that I kept
For a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time
I got mor flavour then a truck load of Snickers
Ya punch her by the straps, ya got ta kick her, fuck it!
That's how it go when ya dealin' with a pro-per
Got my hand on the mic and I'm about to let it flow
Coolio locc and I'm down ta blast
Peter Piper picked a paper, pick a pepper's and I jacked his ass
Motherfuckers curse me but they can't hurt me
When I'm doin' dirt, that's why I show no mercy
I flips tha scripts and it's tha dips when I rips
And rock tha fuckin' house for the Bloods and Crips
Danger danger, ol' gangsta gangsta
Droppin' dogs on the ??? ???
40 Thevz and the band witta plan to make some stops
Niggas die on the street but they don't play taps
Or 21 gun salute, there ain't cahoots
My name ain't Alex Haley but I still got roots
I bang bang bang to the air now ya dead
It was a black and white thang but now it's blue and red
This ain't an episode of Batman, it's more'n like a Blackman
Slap yo' ass up and I jacked ya for ya Walkman
Niggas on the top and you don't deserve nothin'
They fightin punks, their rags is fucked, they shouldn't even be bumpin
Suckas play the back 'cause I'm dope when I rap
And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac
And it's like that!

It's time for me to step so I'm steppin in deep (deep)
I was born a thief so ya know I'm on the creep
Sucka nigga wanna test me but he can't best me
Buck-buck to the chest and I guess you're death-ly
Now I gotta treat ya like a sucka
'Cause you're soft like butter, you punk motherfucker
C-C-Coolio but you can call me Boo
I drop da shit on ya lyrics 'cause ya rhyme style is doo-doo
Ass, faeces, you don't wanna see me
With a flashlight 'cause I serve dat ass (right, right, right)
Word to the motherfuckin homies and you know you can't hold me
Or throw me... so blow me
How many niggas must I stick
Before you get my d'ift and fully understand not to fuck with this
I never been a stoner, take ya momma home and blown her
One night stand and once again she's a loner
'Cause I won't be played out, strung out, laid out
She only gave it up because she thought I had some crack
And I won't be strayed by a lame ass dame
Keep my dollars in my pockets 'cause I'm hip to ya game
Hoes be acting like they love me but they only wanna fuck me
And suck me but don't touch me
Back up off me hooker 'cause I won't be taken
Go find you another motherfucker you can break it
I gots ta keep playin' these niggas like ping-pong
And hit 'em like King Kong, they singin' the same song
'93 is the year and yes I'm gettin' bigger
Gave a shot to the 121 'cause they my niggas
Scotty B ridin' shotgun, BOOM he got one
Only God knows if he'll catch a hot one
Knick-knack paddy-wack Wino's in the back
And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac
And it's like that

I got my hand on my nutsac

And it's like that"

Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised G
Slept ? stage have you slippin' down blazin'
In pools of alcohol walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this you gonna take a fall
Infamous Queensbridge kid we on the scene kid
Creepin' for those that's caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew back my every move

Obey me or get sprayed with the street sweeper
'Cause I'm my brothers keeper

Stay intoxicated never sober
Face it, violate and get laced while you wastin'
Slugs you ain't buckin' nothin'
You better off buckin' yourself you need to stop frontin'
I use to drive an Ac and kept a mac in the engine
Little painted it black with crack sales intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me accompanied by the Coniac
You can ask around don't fuck with the Mobb
I could of told you that where you been at?

Widdy-bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye

Come in!

Many have claimed to attain levels in rhymin'
But when I listen to 'em I see they're only lyin'
They're tryin', but after some years if you ain't got it
Lay it down, put it down, find a way to try and stop it
Or change it, rearrange it, be a producer
Don't touch the microphone because you'll always be the loser
And laughed at, smirked on, you don't belong
With those that perform their song on and on
And on and on and on, yo, let's get specific
This style is for the gifted, poetically uplifted
I speak to you, not at you to attack you
Maybe when I'm through with this rhyme I'll get a statue
So now I ax you or tell you people literally
When it comes to rockin' funky lyrics few are better than me
Down with BDP, endlessly recitin' poetry
Any time I'm in the street, you hear my voice, you know it's me
KR... nope! I'm not ready to say my name yet
Many say they teach, but this style they haven't attained yet

Run it, son, plumb it you bum
Don't you know that it's KRS-One
That comes to sing the styles that ain't sung
I rocked the party, but oh! Gotta run
'Cause only the suckers want a chance at that
To see if KRS-One is really all that
Instead of a rap I jap-slap all of 'em back
Because the teacher that you see is not wack
I'd like to stack up all the hits that I've made
Three albums, a triple-layer cake
And throw it in your face you waste
Pick up the pace and taste a poet from the black race
While I whip you whine, you're out of touch
I'm out of time, here's another rhyme

(The black man's in effect. Jeeeeeeesus! Oh gosh, dude. Oh gosh. Oh
Yes, dude. Yes)

Kyla,Swollen Members,Rap,"Madchild:
Who raised by wolves, trained by gorillas
Caged fighters, gangstas and killers,
Skateboard kids, successful drug dealers,
Pro snowboarders, and bikers they all feel us.
I guess it's the adrenaline rush that flows in us.
Run with my sons of death we all winners.
All got fight in our blood, we go-getters.
Something out there that we want, we won't let up.
Battle axe warriors, we armed to the teeth,
And I'm a little monster, a conquering beast.
White rabbit, black sabbath, bad habits.
My girl's in love with a thug, and a drug addict.
Slow evil, back to my high,
Till I poison the oceans, and blacken the sky.
No need being born, horns and wings,
Torn between good, and doing very bad things.
We the underground force protectors,
You don't want to fuck around with the corpse collectors.
My partner, Mr. Cloak'n'Dagger.
I'm the blazin' angel, known for raisin hell,
And we don't plan on changin'.

New breed, full blooded thoroughbreds.
Organized, don't kill without the go-ahead.
Wanna step to my crew? Go ahead.
Once its on, wont stop till we know ya dead.
Street soldiers, you don't want to enter my circle,
There's hundreds of thunderous tempers.
New breed, full blooded thoroughbreds.
Once its on, wont stop till we know ya dead.

Prevail:
Out the mouth of madness, come these truthful words,
Swollen Members will emerge, converge, and over take.
Approach those who make promises they don't intend to keep.
Inferno rise up, but my beliefs, the miracle on earth,
Some will experience, all will see.
I appear in locations, (where) carefully selected.
Prepare for our music as rare as Led Zepplin. (Right)
Were graceful as sharks, when we hunt our profession. (Let 'em know)
You get the bull if you mess with the horns.
You should told your homie, there's a lesson for em. (Tell ya boy)
Be impressed with my storm, it conform from the shoreline,
In wartime it gathers more strength, full of lust. (Yeah)
More like, my goal. Mine shines as bright as prophecy,
Fulfilled by my steel will, and iron fist of M.A.D.
The grand inquisitors, beyond all walls and perimeters
The laws of the land can't limit us. (naw)

New breed, full blooded thoroughbreds.
Organized, don't kill without the go-ahead.

New breed, full blooded thoroughbreds.
Once its on, wont stop till we know ya dead.

Prevail:
My first spirit dance with the strength of a tribal chief,
Deeper then a dead man's chest, there is no rivalry.
We survive time, while we build our crew lethally.
We are the word on the street, yet sworn to secrecy.
Basements, nightclubs, fight clubs, alleyways,
Our people are well prepared, there all waiting for the day, (it's here)
Where they can proudly say ""we fought for a reason"".
Everyone in black bandannas pledging allegiance."

Wait hold the phone, muh'fucker pass the mic
Spread the word like Pastor Ike, this ain't mass but like
We ain't congregatin, mashin tonight
The boys in blue, I'll show you what the brass is like
The perfect storm, like when disaster strike
Or Knievel when he crashed his bike
I'm the ashy type, like the knuckles on an inmate locked up
'Cept I stay on the grind, my ""Blue Collar"" popped up
Blue collar rap, why I call it that?
Shit I know my real niggaz that U-Haul done hauled back
You ain't a stand up man? Well you fall and crawl back
You a long distance thug, the fuck you call that?
See - this is how a track should pound
And if King was alive this is how he would sound
""You a soft-ass nigga, you a mark, you a gump
Fuckin' lame, you a coward, you a punk, you a chuuump""

I'm the light, I'm the fuse, Rhyme-F-E-S-T
I'm {""Dy-no-mite!""}
Niggaz runnin' for cover from the fallin' debris
I'm {""Dy-no-mite!""}
Explosive, nigga blowin' up the streets
I'm {""Dy-no-mite!""}
I'm the keg, I'm the powder, I'm the fuse, I'm the lighter
If it look like a fire I'm {""Dy-no-mite!""}

(Rhymefest)
You would never stand the challenge
What the preacher preachin what the teacher taught
I dropped out of school, stayed on the street and fought
Like Disciples! Jeffrey manner to be exact
Where how you wear yo' hat made you prone to attack
Made you, made you, made you go and get a strap
And keep you bustin' till your enemies was gone from the map
Like a killer or a man or a giant when I stand
Open my palm bitch, I got the world in my hand
Got a gun and a plan, I got the bible and the Qu'ran
I got a bomb like I live in Iran
I got niggaz to ride with me, hold me down in the street
And deep down I wonder if they the beast, I mean
I mean the police, the feds that police them street
Get in the studio, then try to influence my speech
Like a rat stool pidgeon or a mark or a gump
Fuckin' lame, you a coward, you a punk, you a chump

(Rhymefest)
You would sell your own momma for a piece of a crumb
A piece of the crunk, that ain't even where you from
Youse a follower (what~!) that's right, a fuckin' follower
Probably wearin a wire, so I don't even talk to ya
You think these niggaz is thugs, they officers
Call the oficers, tell 'em get 'em officers, 'fore I show you
'Bout a killer or a man or a giant when I stand
Open my palm bitch, I got the world in my hand
Got a gun and a plan, I got the Torah and the Qu'ran
I got your toddler in the back of a van
I got a hostage and a list of demands, I gotta gotta
'Bout a thousand dollars say you couldn't sit where I stand
All these niggaz that spit threats, hoes that get wet
My style's runnin' to the toilet, you ain't seen shit yet
Yet, yet and still I keep it hot like, Mexican meals
I got a Cadillac stretch Deville
I can show you how to flip for real
Gangsters don't hold the rock, but they know how to flip it and chill
Dime bag-ass niggaz ain't large
When the Patriot Act come hit they ass with the terrorist charge
And we, is what they made it fo'
You think it's all about Arabs? It's a war on the po', we gotta go
Like a killer or a man or a giant when he stand
Open your palm bitch, we got the world in our hand

Survival Tactics,Styles Of Beyond,Rap,"Point missed, lesson learned by way the table tops turned
To my concern, you failed to practice, survival tactics and got burned
In one ear and out the back of my impact year
To boost your self-esteem and camoflauge your wack career
Got yourself the flops and flossin but you forget
That your one hit ain't feedin them 5 babies 'n' shit
Keep the fat rat rich and he'll backflip
Bending over wack words, like you expect, I got you facin backwards
Right back where you started, cold, gettin' retarded
Thinkin' back, bustin' for nothin' but table scraps
Fish all that, we're on a fully loaded expedition
For suckers actin' shifty like a manual transmission
Ammunition comes in a black cloak
Sneak up on em, let the suckers fly once, then I snap his throat
The infamous, Los Angeles, lyricist
San Fernando Val, Southern Cal when they experience it

Here it comes, some survival tactics
We keep it movin in the place, ain't no time for practice
That's how we do make the crowd shout is all that counts
And all amounts, gettin' love, makin' heads bounce
Survival Tactics

Now, whether you like it or not, we still arrive
Bright and early up in yo' face with somethin' live
Spinnin on the kerosil but fail to realize
I'm the supreme energizer no (yeah) rhyme state
Nothin' but a circus with a flying trapeze of emcees
Not to talk shit but man please
Headquarters units alarm, Styles of Beyond
Comin' through military troops to bring battles call
A roadmap to the island of survival
Wallow at the kids that love to do what I do
Bleach'll make you jump and get ridiculous
Prepain for the ride, grab my popcorn and licorice
Chill, have a seat, get a drink, maybe watch
But if it ain't the real, second thought maybe not
This'll make the time for when it's really time to drop
Collect the Navy Seals, scuba dive for hip hop (hip hop)

Here it comes, some survival tactics
We keep it movin in the place, ain't no time for practice
That's how we do make the crowd shout is all that counts
And all amounts, gettin' love, makin' heads bounce
Survival Tactics

What goes up must come down, gravity kills
But tragically emcees got more egos than skills
Watch your back whip the carseat with a closed fist
'Cause it's survival of the fit man, even the strong get dissed

So now we drop down, parachutes, backtrack it slow
Through the roof, survival tactics on the loose
Secret agent combination, junkyard, daily route
Sell the star ranks, snatchin piggy banks that escape
Load the armored tank with the ammo and the ratchets
Man, you know the time (what's the time?), time for action

What's the reaction, keep a close caption
Collapsin emcees, wanna be stuck on something like Michael Jackson
Within a split second of a fraction, Ryu's attackin
With the first of a strapped regiment assassin

Here it comes, some survival tactics
We keep it movin in the place, ain't no time for practice
That's how we do make the crowd shout is all that counts
And all amounts, gettin' love, makin' heads bounce

(Monoxide)
On my way and my face is painted [lets ride]
Annihilated Off that? Fader rated?
Don't matter what anybody is saying lately
'Cause that Twiztids shows tonight
And I made it [hell yeah]
Trunk banging, Juggalos hanging
Some smokin' weed and everybody dranking [pass dat]
I Pull up to the clubs and spot
About 200 people in the parking lot
I got a fat ass blunt, that I spark to start
And a fake I'd so I can hit the bar
They never know it's not me
'Cause the contacts and paint got me
Looking like something ya ate
And I see all the homies painted
And I'm glad that they came
We get the mosh pit started when they hit the stage
Like someone let a bunch of lions out of they cage
And when it's all said and done I won't sleep for days

I'm going to catch the show
Let's get tore down
Lets loose control
Tonight... let's get fucked up at the show... lets go.
I'm going to catch the show exhibits from the carnival
Exquisite freaks and clowns - Oh My

(Madrox)
Hopped in my ride and I head to my homies house
Got two tickets for the show
And I'm destined to check it out
I been listening for a minute
But never been to a show
So when it come to my neck of the woods
Hell yeah I'm finna go
And I'm ready and as I pull up in front of my homies house
He come out with a fifth of Patrone, a blunt up in his mouth
And he tell me if I really wanna make it tonight
He know two juggalettes that's going, but in need of a ride
So I said hell yeah
I'm freaky and lookin' to cut
I hope them bitches just as freaky lookin' rubbin my butt
And make my toes curl every time I'm bustin' a nut
So when I see a pretty bitch I'm like you sittin' up front
Next to me
She like Twiztid and ICP... Boondox and Blaze
And she's down with the family
She lookin' through my cds and she stops at wicked
And said ""baby I forgot my ticket"" DUMB BITCH

I'm going to catch the show
Let's get tore down
Lets loose control
Tonight... let's get fucked up at the show... lets go.
I'm going to catch the show exhibits from the carnival
Exquisite freaks and clowns - Oh My

(Madrox)
My boss said I gotta work but I don't care
The shows coming to my hood and best believe that imma be there
In the front row with my hands held high
Hoping hot bitches with big titties will stage dive
So I can cop a feel as they float right past
Even candy ain't as sweet as some Juggalette ass
Imma blast on the motha fuckas in the most pit
Keep shoving till the fuckas got blood in they spit

(Monoxide)
Now the shows all done and we come back together
Like weed in blunts and your teeth from uppercuts
And remember... party up in 208
Two lettes are gonna makin' out killa like sex tape
Wait...
Gotta get a little more of the Grey Goose
So I can mix up with my gatorade and let loose
Probably wont remember a thang until a day or two
But I know this show is hotter than the flames on a BBQ

I'm going to catch the show
Let's get tore down
Lets loose control
Tonight let's get fucked up at the show lets go.
I'm going to catch the show exhibits from the carnival
Exquisite freaks and clowns - Oh My

Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!"

Right around the block use to slang wraps round

It's a haunted house, got sold by the pound
If you wanna dance, think about it right now
See, I'm not in it yo listen, I'm not in it
This song's about beats, streets, I walked in it
When hit I get defensive 'cause he kris-krossed in it
I've known who I am for longer than I've remember
But that was before I met you, so don't try eject into
Some old-school memories, they never came up
I was never seen clean, so don't get it mixed up

Sock 'em out, STOP now

Yeah I'm in the house

I got friends who star for theyselves
Gold-rimmed cronies with a handful of shells
In the next Tuesday, I'll line myself with crisp
On the CBC, they film me above the hips
Look at that car I drive, I whip it real good
Devos, titos, rims, ghost ridin' and it feels good
No, that ain't ""real"" hood
No that ain't lifestyle
I just rap about it so the kids can clap about it
I rap about drugs, I do it for my family
Sold those packs from the back of a Camary

Half of these rappers thugged it out
I've never had fun in the club scene
Yo I dance real close in the club scene
Started a real toast in the club scene
It's lovely
The club scene loves me, I spend my time in it
4 days a week, yo I write my rhymes in it
Drink ""grasshopper"" with a couple lines in it
I know some bathrooms they did a couple lines in em
At the studio I get a couple styles out
Wait in line for drinks, it's another time out
Made out on the floor with a couple dames
How come I never seem to get what my money is spent?

Y'all know what I'm talking bout
When it's time to rock about
Sock 'em out, STOP now

Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop
Not R&B because to me that's not my style and
The R-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul

In the outback, on the songwritin ship
Blizz a five, off a Bob Marley spliff
On the cloud I be relaxin from last night and shit

Was on the Westside asleep without a clue when
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone
And tell him to get ready (?uestion, what ya doin'?)
(Ain't no thing) Yeah,
Buttered chicken wings, so I met him in the West
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bes'

A girl says, ""Hey ain't y'all The Square Roots?""
And I'm like, ""Heh, worrrd,""
And then the shorty passed the sign
Now we got to make out exit (where?)
To the pavement (to what?) Crushin trail mix
(Oh word man, yo look out) Say what? (look out!)
?Uestion dropped a whole bag of drumsticks
(Ain't no thing) but a chicken wing, so
He bends down to pick up the sticks
And his pants fall down (dang!)

Now you got no proof
'Cause I burnt all the evidence
And the game ain't been the same ever since
I killed the fresh MC, he died yesterday,
I shot him in the head
With the A.K.

Bodies drug for them
Graves get dug for them
On the microphone slugs... I throw them... uh...
Bodies fall...
Act like you don't know

In my mind it slowly sinks in,
Dead bodies starting to stinking
I been smoking, I been drinking,
To myself I start to thinking
In my mind it slowly sinks in,

Bodies stinking evil forces
I can smell their rotting corpses
Maggots crawl around in the grounds

Evil dogs, bark at night

Who am I?
I am E-S-H-A-M you know me
And I will tell you this

Penitentiary chances, and

Train,Flipsyde,Rap,"Sunshine feelin' static through your body you don't know what's going on
Then a creep crawl the mind bends bet it all then cash in and be gone
'Cause it's side corners and street lights caught in this haze and I here them callin'

I hear that train just callin', callin' me home
I hear that train just callin', callin' me home
I hear that train just callin', callin' me home

I had a dream that everything wasn't the way it seemed
Martin was the President and Malcolm the VP
Bush wore a rubber and W was never born
We never bombed Nam and never went to Desert Storm
Little babies was birthed to ladies and grown men
Instead of gangsters and bitches not knowing were to begin
Because we born into this world to die trained to kill steal and lie
Raised to sin just to survive framed 'cause if we caught we fry
Somebody save us they said the saviors comin'
But if he ain't got nuclear weapons he should keep on runnin'
'Cause they bombin' the palaces churches and temples and mosques
We got the freedom of speech until yo ass get shot
Where's the train

I hear that train just callin', callin' me home
I hear that train just callin', callin' me home
I hear that train just callin' callin' me home

Sometimes the candlelight is brighter than the sunshine darkness is long gone
Diggin' my soul still not knowing what's going on
Four in the morning a thousand miles away from home
Glassy and tight eyes reddish and off white oberserving the ice
Swimming in my cup until it's right 'cause it's midnight I'm in the devils daughter and it's so tight
I'm doin' it till I'm gone midnight I'm in the devils daughter and it's so tight
I'm doin' it till I'm gone

I hear the train just callin', callin' me home
I hear the train just callin', callin' me home

Makes his home all over the place

Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless

Go to bed late, then I have to wake
Get to work, keep it goin', can't stop, can't take a break
Gotta get it done, in time for me to do the things I wanna do
But by the time I finished it, it's time for me to talk to you
And then explain what I do in my day, well
It's complicated and you say, ""Pray tell""
And I will try, if I miss any details
Think about it later and then send it in an e-mail
'Cause my brain is on a loop, but there's a buzz
That I need to troubleshoot, not now
Gotta-gotta get the work done
Last night, some other day is turnin' to the first one

So bizarre how so many bullets missed my head
I told my mom that I'm gonna stick with this instead
Fuck the crackrock, I rapped and hit the jackpot

It's all wiggy rockin' city 2 city
But I still feel my past catchin' up with me
Got mo' ends, bought my mom a gold Benz
But she worry 'cause I still got all my old friends
Hopin' that I slow up and change one day

The Harbor Is Yours,Aesop Rock,Rap,"Dead men tell no tales
Up push the daisies 'til the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux from the farmer's sale
Mr. Big Sleep with the carp and kale

Look
Once upon a time, in the days of yore,
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore,
There was an old pirate who pilot a vile slang,
Had a bird perched on him that swashbuckled the same.

Pegleg navigatin' starboard to port
By the nautical starry night yellin' ""The harbor is yours!""
And you should tell him where you situate the gold,
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones.

Like walk the plank for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers, consume the souvenirs,
And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year,
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer.

Ten summers prior on a night like this,
Crow's nest scoped something afloat to the boat's west,
Swore it blew him a kiss, when he focused
Seen the face of an angel upon the body of a f-f-f-fish.

What the heck, frazzled, his telescope shattered, gathered himself
She was ghost, he was down the rope ladder to deck
Circled the vessel to 360, swiftly,
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss, and whiskey.

Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar,
He'll be the laughingstock of the Barbary Coast War like
""This dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearin' his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side!""

Now he knew what he saw, but had to prove he was raw,
So he raped and he pillaged and he feud and he brawl.
Tried to rekindle his rep via sabers and gunsmoke,
And vowed to always find her, though he never told his cutthoats.

(Hey!) Meanwhile, back in the now,
Got a brand new skeleton crew on the move out,
When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern abow,
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth.

Okay, youth wanes, old age holler wisdom and disease,
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed,
And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat,
'Til his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map.

One look down and leapt off the dock-
See if you can guess where X marked the spot-
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave,
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mermaid!

Anchors up, hoist the Jolly Roger, thank you much!
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched,
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong,
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog.

Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand.
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand,
And nary a high tide so grand as the one
That put the lady of the lake on dry l-l-l-land.

Well I wish I could tell you that it ended happy,
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping,
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water.

No lies, scout's honor, got a million more,
From the burgundy lighting above the Shores of Whores,
Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails,
Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales!

Dead men tell no tales
Up push the daisies 'til the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux from the farmer's sale
Mr. Big Sleep with the carp and kale.

This Is It,Inspectah Deck,Rap,"I came in the game, young nigga banging for fame
In the process, staking my claim
And I train like, Leonidas son, the fire and sun
The blood, sweat and tears, grinding for ones

Nearly died for it, cried for it, hustle and flow
Right from the seed, competing with my love for the dough
The hunger it burns, I wondered and yearned
They tried skipping my turn
This time, muthafuckas gon' learn

About the rap general, Rebel, I stack regular revenue
Globally local mogul, vocally soldier hold you
Dude faking and fronting, you just say that you want it
I'm the next Nike ad, greatness is nothing

Who run it, I'm coming, I can't, won't, don't stop blunted
'Til the dough stop coming, 'til the hoes stop stunting
Label it a rap, case closed, no discussion
I'm back to the block, got the whole spot dumbing

I hear plenty barking, got the semi sparking
It's my time, this is it, like I'm Kenny Loggins
Empty cartridge like Hannibal A-Team
Stop me, wake out your day dream

Stay out the way, please
Before you have me facing like eighteen
It's gotta be, then let it be
I'm straight in them state greens

I've been through it all, still stuck in the mud
Eating good, living right, still them fuckers a judge

Like a nigga can't get no greats, when I hit,
Make the bricks go ape 'cause I spit cocaine
And I'm leaning em, blue coats is beaming 'em
Rolling with the team and 'em
But really only few folks are seen with 'em

Y'all better mark my words
Before it's all set and done
I'm a stun y'all like Spock and Kirk
Honor the rep, UD's, Donnie and Fes
P.C. Fisk, Banga, straight body a set

I even the odds, I'm bleeding, I'm scarred
A nickel bag in the trunk, believe I'm involved
I'm on everything, 'cause I ain't feeling the job
Your boy Deck's a king, keep it realer than y'all

Or say keep it true, you watching like the streets'll do
Hip hop is falling apart, Deck, he's the glue
Haters get off me, you sinking my ship
Fixing your lips, yapping like you thinking he slip

I got a million niggas thinking he sick, a million kids
Thinking he rich, a million bitches think he the shit

Speaking my pain, hater I'm the reason you came"
Psych Evaluation,Canibus,Rap,"Yo, some say the pen overpowers the sword
The video camera is just as powerful when it records
Appalling footage of cops breaking the law
Mad at you because of what you saw, now they're breaking your jaw
I've been accused of being internally preoccupied
'Cause the rhymes talk to me and I talk to the rhymes
Clinically induced impulses reveal what's hidden
Written prescriptions given by qualified clinicians
Lafayette pegboards be spinning on turntables
To determine the motor coordination available
Those able to speak what I spoke repeat my quotes
My systematic treatment approach be deep in their throats
I inject the frontal lobe of the brain with a lethal dose
Of unspeakable dope worse than opium smoke
Well spoken like Washington Post or a Fox News Network host
Scale intelligence like Wechsler Adult
Nonnormative data brain storage matter couldn't capture
A couple of years ago they had to put it on Napster
Resurrect Rip the Jacker to rip these rappers
For every second the clock ticks I'ma attack ya

The C-A-N dash I dash
B-U-S gets the last laugh before the critical mass
In half the speed of a bulb flash fire will engulf that ass
Into a molehill of charcoal ash
Only to be blown away by a cold draft
Wack emcees got no chance, It's so sad
They ask Canibus, 'Will you ever run out of things to say?
How much breath can a man breathe in a day?'
Needless to say, I think it's kind of deep in a way
People be like Bis is too ill keep him away
It's a good thing I got patience
I've been waiting here longer than Dr. Levinson's time equations
Trying to figure out what made men, was it the theory of inflation?
Or are we just the product of the ape stem?

You think because I'm not on a major I can't bust?
And because I come from the ghetto that I can't adjust?
Yeah, my disposition was rough
But it turned me into a quick learner all I need now is some luck
I used to be an undisciplined piece of faecal matter
An underdog rapper but I closed that chapter
I deal with my adaptive difficulty faster
And question my projective technique as a rapper
I've lost interest in the battle glory and glamour
But I can't control Rip the Jacker when he gets amped-up
It doesn't matter we've all got a dark side
A loud mouthed Mau-mau from the apartheid

Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night yo I wuz hittin like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So grab your eight plus one, start flippin and trippin'
Niggas is jettin I'm lickin' off son

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang!)

[Verse Six: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide, when he dies?
In his own iniquity it's the
Master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at cha'
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a Master
Evidence indicates that's it's stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend, and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
The styles like alive paralyzin the victim
You scream, as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
Or ninja any motha fuckin' contender.

[Chorus: Method Man]
My peoples are you with, me where you at?
In the front, in the back killa-bees on attack
My peoples are you with, me where you at?
Smokin' meth hittin cats on the block with the gats

*Immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible.*

*Toad style is immensely strong, and immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible.*

Obie Trice - real name, no gimmicks.

Eminem:
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back, back?
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Looseys, I remember loosey (x8)

Well, bust how I'm flippin, flappin
Rippin up the rappin'
Look at the way I kick it, I'm wicked, it happen
One night in Manhatten, chillin', buggin
Me and some of the crew went around to this club and
Peeped it, scoped it, hope the shit was rockin'
Stuns by the bunch had the hunch they was clockin
Stepped up, dressed up, the young got some weed back
Honey got done then begun talkin' to me, jack
I kicked slang to her, all my niggas knew her
I wanted to gas ahead and take her back to the sewer
To do her, screw her
I knew I had to hush
When I felt my belly drop and the spot turned to mush
Um, shush shush, I need me a push
I felt loosey bubblin, trouble in my tush
Then the gush came gushin, rushin, splat!
The juice hooked my Davy D's quick like that
Smack, I biggity-broke my bitch from behind
Tried ta shake it, fake it
But yo I couldn't hide from...

Well, dosey-do your partner as I start the intro
'Cause nobody does it better, correcta-mondo
Back in '86 I was dick with the skills
Playin' ball in the gym with my nigga from the Ville
I was runnin' it like the trooper, had no time to play the small cat
I had it goin' on, word to mother I was all that, black
So one day, believe it or not, I'm chillin'
I was playin' against these niggas from The Bronx for some chitlins
So bust it, I'm in it with my coojas, gimme the rock, G
I float like a butterfly and kick like karate
I scored 26, I caught a fake and now I'm Audi
I'm takin' it to the hoop and then this kid tried to foul me
(HA!) Boom to the gutter, I hit the floor, I wanted to flip
I couldn't, damn, all of a sudden I had to shit
So I dipped to the sewer, I couldn't control the shit because it
Slipped past my dick, drip drip like a faucet
Down past my shorts and hit the court and all of a sudden
Girls were gettin' sick, all my niggas they was buggin
I made it to the bowl leavin' behind a trail of dookie
My drawers are soakin wet and I'll never forget the day I met...

Gotta lick dem shot, gotta lick dem tits,
'Cause your task is da coocoomanka cause me rhymes is hot

Snuggles:
Figgas what would you rap about
Without wack mcs you'd feel the drought
Give it up one two three for me
Don't need a shield 'cause I'm liquid g
Liquidise before eyes can't see through can't see me
Bunnys bounce to fast to flee
Beat the bounds I'm breakin free
Your hip hops in uniform
Why don't you blow your puny horn
Watch me rap like a unicorn
Sun goes up, its newly born
Break it down for the break of dawn
Shake the shore with the beam I shone
Signalise tapdancin morse
Hip hop police better change the laws
Hip hop police we derange your laws

Maloke:
Stop - Freeze - Hip Hop Cops
You have the right to remain in the creature shop
Or you can chill in a c old chillin' cell
Oh well, don't ask don't tell
Don't rock the boat for Pete's sake
No room for mistakes in this hip hop police state
Search warrants for overpaid informants
Puppet Mastaz always a performance
Swattin like SWAT teams that swat flies
We on the rise 'cause we got wise
To the boys downtown they took us and book us
Shook us down to the tuckus for causin a ruckus
We broke the law, law daw de daw
I ain""t sure what I saw but it looked like a claw
Tapped me on the shoulder - Tap Tap
And said Mr Maloke ""Do you have a permit to rap?""
I said: No 'cause I give a hoot
For wannabe brutes in Tim Boots and matching tracksuits
Now they got me on the lam with a fake passport
Slipping through security at the airport
Croucho picked me up in the helicopter
The fuzz killing the buzz of Mr Malock, ah
You look the same you sound the same you act the same
Y'all should hang your headphones in shame"
Party For Your Right To Fight,Public Enemy,Rap,"Power, equality
And we're out to get it
I know some of you ain't wid it
This party started right in 66
With a pro-Black radical mix
Then at the hour of twelve
Some force cut the power
And emerged from hell
It was your so called government
That made this occur
Like the grafted devils they were

J. Edgar Hoover, and he coulda proved to you
He had King and X set up
Also the party with Newton, Cleaver and Seale
He ended, so get up
Time to get 'em back
(You got it)
Get back on the track
(You got it)
Word from the honorable Elijah Muhammed
Know who you are to be Black

To those that disagree it causes static
For the original Black Asiatic man
Cream of the earth
And was here first
And some devils prevent this from being known
But you check out the books they own
Even masons they know it
But refuse to show it, yo
But it's proven and fact
And it takes a nation of millions to hold us back"
Dream,KRS-One,Rap,"(Feat. Minister Server)

(Minister Server: speaking)
The God of your understanding, has chosen you and you've agreed
To be here in this space and time to do something, that only you can do
Now I won't stand here to try and tell you what it is
But deep, inside yourself
As you take time to uncover, and ask yourself some vital questions
Like - what is it that brings me peace, what is it that brings me joy?
What do I love doing?
What am I willing to become highly skilled at doing?
What part can I play for the betterment of the society
And the world in which I want to live?
When you begin to ask yourself those real questions
And it doesn't have to be done in a formal way
It can be done just like we're speaking, right now
Ask yourself the question
Look at how you see yourself in just a year from now
And then go forward
And if you have children or even if you don't have children
Now begin to, look at your future beyond
The space and time that you are
Now visualize exactly, the way that you desire to live
Don't be afraid to, dream"

Get Me Out,Playa Fly,Rap,"(First Verse)
Jumpin', pumpin, dumpin, somethin' bumpin all my doggs enjoy
When the crowd surround me
Speakin' loud like clouds that rain stop pourin
Born and raised with ways to get me paid off in a major way
Tricks and slickin', tickin', trickin' lemons all up out they pay
Damn what a nigga say
I told 'em 'fore I folded up this industry
Once they turned me loose I told the truth with every piece of me
Triple Bitch, the songs'll rock
Blackout and me done got you hot
Victim of this shit provided Fly still flyin' to the top
Stretched it out from side to side, from top to bottom open wide
Just so we can ride and bump all high upon this Southern side
Mane I'm hangin', sangin', champagne rangin' till it ain't no Earth
Bumpin' out the frame is not a thing, just time to put in work
BALLIN' on the fuckin' slab
BALLIN' in the fuckin' lab
CALLIN' on my doggs with daps and haulin' ass with pen or pad
I told ya I'll torch y'all
Through the North while spinnin' out the Dirty South
HEARD ME I SAID DIRTY SOUTH, now get me some and get me out
Get me out

Deep down in the dirty heard me,
Get me some and get me out,
Ballin', fallin', callin', haulin',
Ass up through the North and South

(Second Verse)
If you suckas comin' after, attack you for some ??? cheese
Scratchin', bitin', fightin' for some excellence and expertise
No matter what the Sarah Conner
We gonna get it, brother another of this rubble that'll hustle sometimes undercover
Paint familar tainted me
Minnie Mae, Black O-U-T
Achin' combination that's gone take it to the T-O-P
No surrender to contenders
Just dismember all pretenders
If I wanna remember
From December back round to November
As the time start fallin' fast
Suckas start to fallin' fast
Callin' on the law at last
The law ain't bout to haul that ass
Deep down in the dirty cut
Get me out pick up for what?
Livin' right here where I'm stuck and lovin' every minute, bruh
Dirty, dirty South, yes sir us thugs that you been hearin' of
Same ol' Parkway niggas, jigga bigger than you thought we was
All up in and out the North, and always goin' through the South
The plugga from down under, I'll come get me some and get me out
Get me out

(Third Verse)
Rock and sock and state of shock is what this playa left you in
On the spot and off your socks I knock one, Flizy bombed again
This my third and final round, Fly think it's time I shut you down
Pound you with this sound into the ground
Unless you toss my crown
Fly be downin' dirty South
Dirty South be downin' Fly
Punk, and dank, and drank you under the table is the way we get high
If I fall, it's with my thugs
Ballin' fast or meaner mug
Always count on God above and haul my boxed-up World with love
See me flexin' dubs, twistin' blunts up to capacity
Deep down in the dirty, heard me, that's the way it has to be
I-B-N to smokin', chiefin', chokin' rollin' ghetto green
High as it could be and C and B the light has ever seen
Fly will see you peekin', seekin', creepin' what you don't deserve
Awake and shake on green and let my champagne kick me to the curb
Have you heard me? Out that DIRTY, DIRTY I said DIRTY SOUTH

(Inspectah Deck)
I once asked God to forgive for my sins
Bent on my knees pleadin to be heavenly cleansed
Said the Holy Ghost changed the ways and actions of men
When I stood, I felt the same as if I just walked in
I was twelve at the time, held nines, held mines
A frail mind, criminal thoughts well-designed
Then the Older Gods put me on, on how to rock this
Maintain, 360, lord and live prosperous
His jewel was priceless, keep the cypher righteous
Bare in mind, God, some of your own won't like this
I'm mentally scarred, recooperatin from abrasure
Fooled by interpretations made from a traitor
It's in my nature, I was taught, that's the first law
Obtain the food, clothin and the shelter that I search for
The fire in my eyes is hot as Earth's core
What hurts more, the fact that we still dirt poor
In hard times force crimes out of honest man
And most fiend to see the so-called promised land
Sun of Man, knowledge, wisdom and understand
That it's time to take matters in our own hands

(Inspectah Deck)
The wicked ways of the world can't escape sin
I'm facin masses gun on the plantation
Seen source from home yet I'm still caved in
'Cause 9000 miles is such a long way to swim
And many die tryin' to survive the next mile
Famillies was raised as slaves and exiled
I learned it as a child, knowledge be the key
To unlock your brain and set your mindstate free
It's true, the times come through, chose the few
Show and prove, the power of God's in you
Or remain a savage in pursuit of happiness
Who lacks jewels, love and peace completes the package
The fact is five out a hundred know the truth
The wisdom might blow the roof when shown and proved

(Inspectah Deck)
Through the course of time, we was dumb, deaf and blind
Now we on the incline, build with one mind
Came a long way, but, yo, we still far behind
So, uplift the mind, God, rise and shine
I speak to the black-bellied yellow seeds
My fellow breed all races, colors and creeds
Search for the knowledge, use science and math
And be queens and kings like the centuries past
The devil tried to fool my people, said we was equal
But I believe him when my culture sees freedom
You beat 'em with the positive thoughts, you don't need em
Leave him in the dirt, let the blood suckers see him

5,6,7,8,9,10 for the flows

Drama, so close to not completing the missing piece of the puzzle
Quit again, in again, drop suit be following
Swallowing prod like porn stars and money shots
I'm hitting ya blocks, spinning as heavy as SUVs doing 360
I'm ready as ever, over due like the rain in New York
Sustained a steady fan base, but you still don't know me
Hold me in your highest regards, I'm your homie
I relate it's personal, nothing fake, read me - wait, I'd rather dictate it
Relay it to you on a deeper level

Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes
For sho' it's crunch time, I'm the one they sent to piss your label off
They won't fuck with me, unless I'm parading and taking it off

It would burn a set control well admit

In less than one second she's already spitting
I need y'all, you want a change? well here it is
Let's stop complaining, make it happen, everybody step up your game
'Cause everybody's stuck in park or reverse
Letting the media choose your path and rape you, market you less than you worth
I was gonna throw your towel in
But honestly you cats deserve some better music
Plus, come on, what else would I be doing? Shit...

If, like my people said, ""I left it to you""
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?)
If I didn't try a verse, if I didn't rhyme

If I just hated and did nothing to change it

Hell no, that could never happen

There's so much further to go
I feel like Mindy Cohen doing the One To Grow On
Yeah I'm old school, 40s and high tops
Triple Gooses and Travel Fox
Huaraches and Blow Pops
I'm down to earth but still dreaming
Peace to Skeme Team and all of my niggaz on the come up
Apani and Lyric, we gon' take it there
The rest of y'all just taking up space, and you don't even care
It's like you started eating Thanks Giving dinner without saying grace
I whisper a prayer for you
'Cause you cats are lost and probably not gon' make it back
Fuck it, it's more for me I guess
So please don't stress it
The best is yet to come
This is just an introduction
I'm 'bout to have niggaz madder than big titty girls who getting breast reductions
The purpose of my function is to smash, simply put - trash you
Until you cry ""Uncle mercy"", wander aimless in this concrete jungle and curse me
There ain't a need for verse three I can feel it
That would rob you of your man hood, and I'm not into stealing
So tell me...

Ha-ha, yeah man... And it's only the beginning...
Better choose sides now."
We Ready,Ya Boy,Rap,"Leaders aren't born, they're made
And there made just like anything else through hard work
That's the price we gotta pay to achieve our goal
Let's get it

Last of a dying breed, heart of a lion
All of my soldiers with me, we all right
Ain't no stopping once the red light turn green
I will not lose, I know they heard me

I go hard still fly were the birds be
If he tryna stop me then he gon' need surgery
They can't serve me, waiter or hater
On my way to glory baby I see you later

Ain't nobody promise this
Please check my accomplishments
Better find your niche 'cause you ridin' in the wrong lane
Call me anything besides a king, you callin' me by the wrong name

I'm like LeBron James here and it won't change
See, this is my life, this is not a game
I jam the court if they let me
Ask me if we ready for war, I'ma tell you

We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in

We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in

I got it done when they said I couldn't do it
I never stopped for bullshit, I kept it moving
This is why I grind like Ali in his prime
I put in the work so this is why I shine

Don't tell me I'm great, I hear that all the time
You just tell a friend and spread the word while I climb
And if I don't get the crown for some reason
I be back to put it down for next season

It's on my soul, I put my heart in it
You say you want it real when I'm so authentic
Y'all won't finish 'cause y'all so timid
Every pass, every play, every yard I been in

We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in

We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in

Everybody's got a dream, repeat after me
Not right now but on three
One, two, three, say we ready
One, two, three, say we ready

Go for the crown, don't never back down
Every city you hit make it jump down
We run that city, run that city
Say I run this city, I run this city

Follow the leader, I show you how it's done
I never let us down, we remain number one
All the greats before me gave me the stamp
Remember that name, Ya Boy, your true champ

We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in

We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in

YB, I'm goin' in, it's the lack of fate
That makes people afraid of taking chances
I believe in myself, how 'bout you?
It's not a game, it's more than a game, we ready"
Freedom,Clipse,Rap,"Speak, speak of freedom
Sing of amber, waves of grain

With every line written and all I have given
Music's been nothing more than a self-made prison
I've taken inmate losses at the hands of this one
My pen's been the poison to family and friendships

Now is time to mend ***, time to bring closure to
The clear conscience of Pusha is long overdue
Thinking to myself what can I be owing you
They only tell you great when they reminiscing over you

Before I trouble T-boy, it's just a D-boy
Let me play the role of a common on his B-boy
Speaking my truth in rhyme no matter how bland it is
A heavy heart lighting that's just what my ransom is

All apologies, I bear the cross I wear the blame
We in the same group but I don't share my brother's pain
Not to confuse our sentiments are all the same
I just don't feel nothing, I'm numb by the will to gain

Same thing brought tears to innocence
I turned away and didn't even flinch, yeah
The music drove me crazy looked up and lost the first ***
I ever wanted to have my babies

Nowadays she can't even face me I'm sorry for the heartbreak
I promised you forever my lady, Jodeci baby
Pompus ***, just look what them jewels made me
I'm only finding comfort in knowing you can't replace me

What a thing to say but what am I to do?
I'm role playing a conscious *** and true is true
Cocaine aside all of the bloggers behoove
My critics finally have a verse of mine to jerk off to
I own you all

Speak of freedom
Sing of amber, waves of grain

This is where the buck stop, here's where I draw the line
I touched the hem, God's work is so divine
I seen the error of my ways over time
Never to return, Malicious had been refined

Like wine, with time I get better
Napa Valley vintage, my flow is fermented
Now drink of me, as if I bought the bar
Run to these words as if there's no tomorrow

Never mind my car, careful what you wish for
Behind every curtain the devil and his pitchfork
Jealousy, I ask thee, what is this for?
How was I to know I was happy being piss poor

No whore, that's not love, we was ***
I was in search of a chicken-head, you was clucking
And I was lusting, we were both out of order
I shoulda known better as I'm reminded of my daughter

'Am I My Brother's Keeper' or 'For Himself Every Man'?
I have been your reaper, there's blood on my hands
Accept me as your keeper, there's been a change of plans
Careful what you speak of, I've come to understand, peace

What else do you want from us, huh? What more can you ask
(Speak, speak of freedom)
We'll give you everything, we lost life, we lost love
(Sing of amber, waves of grain)

We lost family behind this ***
This *** you call music, we call this *** life
We gave you proof, they give you ***, we gave you truth
Do I entertain you, ***? Well, dance then ***

She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, ""I love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A., like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum

9 to 5,Lady Sovereign,Rap,"Ok yo...
I wake up late every morning
Manager's calling I'm still yawning
Get up, wake up, hair and makeups
Waiting for you, don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on, I was drunk last night
Now it's all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phone's on silent, I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be...

Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
There's no turning back 'cause I'm working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I am no early birdy, I'm lazy. dat's all dat I can say
So make sure you heard me
And dere's no turning back 'cause I'm working a 9 to 5

So you gotta... do... sum... mit... for... channel... u
Channel who, sorry who, I'm altered for snooze
Oh! Channel you da ones dat made me huge
Like Katie Price's boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my Red Bull and my sandwich I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum
""Action""
Nah I'd actually rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up actually looks quite cute

Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say dat I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy, I'm lazy dat's all dat I can say
So make sure you heard me

Won't wake up till 12:30

I couldn't be bothered to say much ere
So oh dear
Huh where am I man...
This... ain't good... what's going on?!

So my label have changed my image
I'm a pink lipstick chick called Dipstick
This ain't on my wishlist
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting C-beebies
(Pukes) Have you seen me?
Never again, am I drinking Lambrini
""Its all right Sov, it's a dream... jus' wake up!""

Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say dat I meant 1:30

The Way Of Rhyme,Kris Kross,Rap,"I'm the quicker quicker ripper
On a track like this.
The miggity-mac never slacks
And I'm packing the heat.
I got my flavor of lifesavers
Every day I create
Some of the wiggity-slyest rhymes
That you ever heard from one.

I ain't the type to be slept on
The type to be crept on
And don't you think I am to step on.
For every move you make
I got a trick
And my track's got more kicks
Than a boo sleep flick.

I like my pants to sag
Make you say
""Dag, uh! That little nigga is so bad.""
The capital capital K's don't play
We amaze.
They make you move
They groove
In so many different ways.

Jump! Jump!
Was the first episode
To put you in the mode
And let you know
I flow like
That y'all, that y'all,
That y'all, that y'all.

Better than that
Like that y'all, that y'all,
Like that y'all, that y'all,
That y'all, that y'all.

Better than that
Like that y'all, that y'all,
Like that y'all, that y'all,
That y'all, that y'all.

Better than that
Like that y'all, that y'all,
Like that y'all, that y'all,
That y'all, that y'all.

Better than that
Like that y'all, that y'all.

Every everybody wants to know
Where I get my get my funky funky flow.
Straight from the ghetto
And I'm fierce like a dragon.
Head to the back
And my pants keep saggin'.
Here I go again,
Movin' your adrenaline.
Totally totally totally krossed out.
Can you comprehend?

Wait a minute drop the old school beat.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Tupa-tupa girl scooper
That's what I be.
Girls talkin'
You know talkin'
It's the mac daddy.

I got a flow.
You got a what?
I got a flow.

I got a flow.
You got a what?
I got a flow.

On the playground I say now
You won't see me swinging
Skin tight clothes
Then you don't be singing
""Daddy don't do dat. Dad do rap.""
So please don't get passed to the whack.

I got a flow.

So let it go.
Yeah.

Meet me in the mac means I'm all that.
I could do this and that
And none of it ever comes out whack.
And never have you ever seen
A MC this size this tough.
You might have seen some kids
But they wasn't this rough.
I'm the type you don't want to touch,
Tangle or tamper with.
You rhyme to doodle
Like a two-day-old pamper kid.
So spark off and tie

Untimely Meditations,Saul Williams,Rap,"The fiery sun of my passions evaporates the love lakes of my soul
Clouds my thoughts and rains you into existence
As I take flight on bolts of lighting
Claiming chaos as my concubine and you as my me
I of the storm, you of the sea
We of the moon, land of the free
What have I done to deserve this?
Am I happy?
Happiness is a mediocre sin and for a middle-class existence
I see through smiles and smell truth in the distance
Beyond one dimensional smiles and laughter lies our hereafter
Where tears echo laughter you'd have to do math
To divide a smile by a tear, times fear, equals mere truth
I simply delve in the air and if that's the case
All I have to do is breathe and all else will follow
That's why drums are hollow
And I like drums, drums are good
But I can't think straight
I lack the attention span to meditate
My attention spans galaxies
Here and now are immense
Seconds are secular, moments are mine
Self is illusion, music's divine
Noosed by the strings of Jimi's guitar, I swing
Purple hazed pendulum
Hypnotizing the part of eye that never dies
Look into my eyes, are the windows of the soul
Is fried chicken, collards, and cornbread
Is cornmeal, flour, sour cream, eggs and oil
Is the stolen blood of the earth
Used to make cars run and kill the fish
Who me? I play scales
The scales of dead fish, of oil slicked seas
My sister blows wind through the hollows of fallen trees
And we are the echoes of eternity
Echoes of eternity, echoes of eternity
Maybe you've heard of us?
We do rebirths, revolts, and resurrections
We threw basement parties in pyramids
I left my tag on the wall
The beats would echo off the stone
And solidify into the form of light bulbs
Destined to light up the heads of future generations
They're releasing it up in the form of ba boom boom ommm
Maybe you've heard of us?
If not then you must be trying to hear us
And in such cases we can't be heard
We remain in the darkness, unseen
In the center of unpeeled bananas we exist
Uncolored by perception
Clothed to the naked eye
Five senses cannot sense the fact of our existence
And that's the only fact
In fact, there are no facts
Fax me a fact and I'll telegram a hologram
Or telephone the son of man and tell him he is done
Leave a message on his answering machine
Telling him there are none
God and I are one
Times moon, times star, times sun
The factor is me, you remember me
I slung amethyst rocks on Saturn blocks
'Til I got caught up by earthling cops
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me, I swirl like the wind
Tempting tomorrow to be today
Tiptoeing the fine line between everything and everything else
I am simply Saturn swirling sevens through sooth
The sole living heir of air
And I (inhale) and (exhale) and all else follows
Reverberating the space inside of drum hollows
Packaged in bottles and shipped to tomorrow, then sold to the highest nigga
I swing from the tallest tree
Lynched by the lowest branches of me
Praying that my physical will set me free
'Cause I'm afraid that all else is vanity
Mere language is profanity
I'd rather hum or have my soul tattooed to my tongue
And let the scriptures be sung in gibberish
'Cause words be simple fish in my soulquarium
And intellect can't swim
So I stopped combing my mind so my thoughts could lock
I'm tired of trying to understand
Perceptions are mangled, matted and knotted anyway
Life is more than what meets the I and I
So elevate I to the third but even that shit seems absurd
When your thoughts leave you third eye-solated
No man is an island but I often feel alone
So I find peace through ommm"

Drop (Da Beatminerz Remix),The Pharcyde,Rap,"Bootie Brown:

Let me freak the funk,
Obsolete is the punk that talk more junk than Sanford sells
I jet propel at a rate that complicate their mental state
As I invade their masquerade
They couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted
For an easy out, I leave MCs with doubt
Of exceeding, my name is Bootie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading,
They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle, of O.E.
They have no key, or no clue
To the game at all
Now they washed up
Hung out to dry
Standing looking stupid
Wondering why
(Why man?)
It was the fame, that they tried to get
Now they walking around talkin' about represent
And keep it real, but I got to appeal
'Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel

Slim Kid 3:

Rock a bye baby,
Listen to your heart beat pumping to a fine
Ravine of all things it's a vain of a shrine
All missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm
Heading for a new sector 365
Days fron now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye
And each and every true will stick, or fall from the skies of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the worlds at a stand-still
Deep in broken mansville
Trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

Knumbskull #1:

(Shit is-shit is ill)
Through my will
My flow still will spill
Toxic slick to shock sick like electrocute
When I execute, acutely over the rhythm
On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give em
Got 'em mad and tremblin
'Cause I been up in my lab assemblin
Misslies, to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me, and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow, the truth because it hurts
This is how I put it down, this is my earth, my turf
The worth of my birth is a billion, and you know what time it is
I'm going to make a million"

The truth the lies
That bless the lives
In a word all alone
Death, demise
Reject the spies
Respect will rise
In a world so prone
We be never be no equal cause
You be devilish people so

Could you take a couple seconds out of your time
So I can really voice what's on my mind
Look into the eyes of which is not blind
And tell me what you see when I tell ya I'ma strong
Muthfucka, Independent with long-gevity
And I'm a benefit, it's on!
If you thinkin' I'm illiterate (hit home)
When you hear how a nigga spit
So richeous the nicest
You hate that you like it
I give and take through this crisis
So whites and afrkids fighting for life
But I got Mexicans and Asians beside me
Even Caucasians and Jamaicans taking stand in America what's right
This is a war, and you losing with un even scores
One for my your hate, three for minorities and even more
(Backwards Talk)
Reach through my blood and pour
Pour Liquid expanding, vicious explosions the final score

I ride for my people
I die for my people
Stand high on my steeple
To lies treating people
Devils are one sided
Spirits are misguided
Thinking that black birds don't fly
In a whitemans eyes

Doctor Doctor,MIMS,Rap,"Oh man,
I'm fucked up man,
I think I need to see a psychiatrist
My mind's playin' tricks on me man

I said Doctor Doctor, won't you help me
So many sick thoughts see my mind ain't healthy
Mad at the fact that I ain't wealthy
So I sell drugs, ain't shit you can tell me
When he got 10 cars
And I got no car
Waiting at the bus stop, I can't go far
You ain't poor
You don't know what it is like
To be in my shoes man
And see what I live like
Now how could you live life
20 plus years old caught in a mid-life crisis
Fuck who's the nicest
It's about copping them new devices
Italian Ices
Gougin' Prices
When you on top you should see how life is
So unrighteous
But it feels so good
Mad at me like he ain't no good
But it feels so good

I mean
I mean damn, Doc
Shit is going real good for me
I got a lot of fame now
But I don't think I can take it man
Check it out

I said Doctor Doctor, I need help now
Ain't slept in years so I see a meltdown
Either that or a permanent breakdown
Cause my height man ain't learning the breakdown
I'm on tone now
My voice is toned down
Moving too fast but I can't slow down
Doc said ""To Rest, time to cancel the show now""
Fans upset like I'm a no-show
Wow
But I ain't do it on purpose
Behind the fame I'm a regular person
But I feel worthless


The gift and curse is
If I fuck up my voice then it ain't worth it
But I gotta give them what they purchase
If I'm the disciple, then what they worship
Is Hip-Hop, not just a couple of verses
But Doc hold up, I'm just touching the surface

I mean damn, Doc
I can't take this no more man
I'm cracking under pressure
It's a little too much for me man
My minds going crazy right now
Check it out

Doctor Doctor, I'm losing my mind quick
Ain't been shot but it feels like I'm hit
Who would have thought after all I did
And all I gained I would call it quits
5' 9"" but I'm tall as shit
The sky is the limit
Then watch how tall I get
This is what other niggas would call dreams
For me this is life meaning it was foreseen
So why am I complaining
God bless me man
I'm an angel in training
I'd a came in the game with a dash like Damon
Predicted the rain, man
Just like Rain Man
Down in the sun on the island of Cayman
While you and your main man
Still on the mainland
Even real niggas know what I'm sayin'
Ya shit change but I ain't changing for nobody

I mean God-damn, Doc
I been coming to you for the last three years
And you ain't say shit
It seems like I talk my way out of my own problems
And see you getting paid all this money

I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy
I'm crazy man, I'm crazy

You better have the will to bend over and take...

Off your clothes in time...
Conqueror, come back to give some of that old
Pictual, actual, factual; Let Mac'll bring you the raw
With gigantic flow that my people come to love

Azurite, get down with it
Can't fathom these brothers fantastic
Uh, I heard cry when I dip that ass in some plastic
How could you master, you deal with rappin' bastards
Because you asked us if we could bring you fashions
Fascists, because we turn this rap shit into something tragic
I didn't wanna have to put you in some action
Uh, I know you asked but did you really wanna have it?
See, I cause havoc like a loaded automatic...

After the show you know I step up in the place...

Whiplash is what you get when you mashing the gas

Won't catch me in tinted windows

Or various instrumentals and yo...
Got a whole crew and my crew is monumental and yo...
You need to lo and behold these innuendos

My rhyme is universal like a elastic-uh
I hope you feel me like you feel your past-or

And you so used to bab-bl-ing

You like the way it goes down when S attacks-it
It will get tragic when the S is on the mission...

So listen! Relax, take a seat in the place
Its livin'! Living up to expectations and still
Rippin! With rhymes and filling the chrome
Dippin! Cruising the neighborhood is just local
Pimpin'!

Street Ministry,Gang Starr,Rap,"Presenting you with alternative music
'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough, and we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
We gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure
Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping
The faith and trying hard to get straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate
Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it
The future's all in your hands and
So of yourself, yea, you should be demanding
We're all responsible for whatever outcome
That's why I speak over beats for my income
Knowledge is key and if you ask what it is, G
It's just a form of my style of street ministry

Yo, the saga begins, my eyes is the photography lens
Properly push pens, and show quality gems
The horrors be grim, but yo maybe tomorrow we win
If we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend
I want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends
I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins
If I decide we in sin, then my prophesy ends
But the God'll begin, watchin my odyssey spin
In the place where war be, based on a true story
Territory was made for me to pursue glory
Blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn
Every capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo

So all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal
Persona is unbombable?, trust me son
I continue like a saga do, bringin' you the drama to
Allow you that the chronicle has just begun

I quickly spread it, till the whole city's infected
Suspense that I supply intensify
Then commence as my daily events go by
You get involved in this, paragraphologist
Narratin novelist, market this, sound marvelous
I'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic
Most definite, every episode's a epidemic
So when you research, check it, here go the evidence
They represent with lyrical negligence for presidents
My science existed, without the fiction
Every inscription is a special edition

*Chorus A*, *Chorus B*

Yo, the legacy lives, let 'em see what the pedigree is
Mega-thesis, blessin these kids with extra features
The depth's deep as, the deepest sea is
Telepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis
Ideas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters
Lyrics you hear it, devastating the way you ear it
So stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more
So soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store
The names have changed the game remain the same
How one came to reign on his claim to fame
No stoppin' this I'm droppin' this with hip-hop in this
And when the topic is topicless, then I'm writing the apocalypse

Open Your Eyes,Organized Konfusion,Rap,"There's just too many rages
Too many infinite screams at night, we're living in concrete cages
Another child is doomed, to be torn in his mother's womb
By the spark of the twelve gauges
Sometimes it seems like I can't go on, I can't go on
But when I envision a black man with thorns in his hand
On a crucifix I get strong
Never will I ever let a devil deceive me again (HA!) mislead me
'Cause what I'ma hit you with's gonna hurt (yeah)
Because the flesh is meaningless it remains amongst the dirt
But the soul is uplifted
10-31-67 I'm God gifted
MC's are changing it grows like a fungus
Beware of the evil that walks among us, behold
A fallen angel, hark, the rebel
The mark of 6-6-6, the Devil
You better beware 'cause he's comin' behind you
No it doesn't take long for him to find you
It's a sneak attack black, he's gonna smack you
In the form of a rock that's inside of a capsule
Or maybe in the form of a man
That says to trust me and then begins to shake your hand
But when you examined your hand you learned
You're alarmed that your palm was disfigured and burned
No no no no, it's not surprising
Open your book, look to the horizon
Start scoping, open your eyes and strive to
Study the holy Qu'ran or read the holy Bible
I'm making a getaway, plan it's gonna be a better way
There's gotta be a better day

Hmmmmmmm... and now I ask, Lord have mercy upon me
And grant me sight, for what I can't see
For you are the shephard and I shall not want
To front, yes to be blunt, I won't flunk
For I am blessed with the gift of knowledge (yeah)
Without college, but now let's shift
Into the specific dimension that we call Earth
Where God gave us the gift of birth
Last but not least Ephessians 6 tells you to teach the child
Revelation tells about two day swarms, the guns and diseases
Homicides over epidemics and crack vials
Got guns going BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK
And when you look up you see a kid got struck
But mentally the blood pours out of the mother's heart
Cause it hurts to lose to Lucifer's part (mmm, yeah)
Yes, for I have seen the light
That shines bright even in the dark of the night
And I (I) thank (thank) thee (thee)
For constantly watching over me
There are about, four hundred and fifty-thousand homeless without housing
Brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
They can't seek a job with this hair that's dread
Sit back and face reality with these lyrics
I hope they can uplift your spirits
(We're living in the last days, we're living in the last days)
Cause God made water and trees food man woman
Land fire grass animals clouds and sunrays to shine
On the parents of those twenty-six kids that died last year (last year)
And it's a shame it's a crying shame, uh
Sometimes I felt that I was there
You better get up and wipe to clear your eyes
And get right with the master of disguise"
It Ain't A Crime,House Of Pain,Rap,"Johnny was a bad boy
He was a juvenile delinquent
He had his picture
On the wall of every precinct
He had a rep for hangin' out with his homies
Puffin' on the blunts
And sippin' on the 40's
But when he spoke
Nobody would listen
And when he was home
His parents, they would diss him They called him a bum
A worthless piece of shit
So over this he had a fit
And now he grabs his bag
And heads for the door
And walks to the neighborhood
Liquor store
Pulls out a gat
And tells the old man, ""Hit the floor""
Then breaks open his register drawer
Pulls out the money
Stuffs it in his pocket
Points his pistol
Then he starts to cock it
The man panicks and the gun goes off
Stupid old fool
Made Johnny blow his head off
But he don't care
'Cause he was taught
It ain't a crime
If ya don't get caught

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
That's how it is homie like it or not

Now, comin' out of the store
Johnny shot two acpedic Jews
When he got home
His face was on the news
His mom freaked out
Told him, ""Get the fuck out""
That's when the pigs rolled up
So, yo he ducked out
He hit the back door
Like his name was Carl Lewis
Dipped to the pay phone
To find out where his crew is
He called up his home boy Jose[word up]
""Can I come over, my man?""
He said, ""No way!""
The cop- was here
He was lookin' all over for ya
But I told the pig
I didn't know ya
He said, ""Cool,
Pick me up at the school
I need a ride 'cause
I'm wanted for homicide""
Johnny's got his gun
And he's on the run
But he don't care
To him, the shit's fun
Now that he's an outlaw
Sorta like Robin Hood
The hard-rock hero
Of the whole neighborhood
If they catch him
He'll wind up in court, but
It ain't a crime if ya don't get caught[ha ha]

It ain't a sale if it don't get bought
It ain't a show if I don't get paid
She ain't a ho if ya don't get laid"

She call me everyday
Anyway, I got a crew that always give you what you need
We don't hold it against you
If your crew ain't up to speed
See, we be them
We be them niggas S-V
You can do what you gotta do
You will never see three (three)

Maybe it's that nigga Titus
Maybe it's me
Maybe he's part of the group (the) S and the V
Maybe my name is Rasaul Rassi
Maybe I'm Christ?
Maybe the Sun
The One
Maybe I'm the nigga who pulled the gat first (maybe)
Pointed at the casket and blasted at the hearst
Niggas they front (hard). You just learning to roll the blunt (huh)
Been there (hehe), done that (nana)
I'm on that other shit
Gradually speeding out my body till I fell away
Maybe my crew is like an omen, from the great lake
Maybe I'm the first fish who bit at the bait (bait)
Catching a crab from a bitch on a blind date
Maybe it was Titus who paved the way
Maybe it was Titus who came to save the day
Maybe you like me. Maybe you don't. You give a fuck (fuck)
Probably with my crew that made you raise it up

Go sportin and Jordans and I'm on the balls
Don't lackin I'm black but I'm not ?Lou Wrong?
Disappeared for a year now I'm back y'all
So get down with the entrepeuner of funk
Not a sloppy fat punk or a Shaolin Monk
Ain't down with Johnny Cousin know as use at a jam
So to hell with Anne McMahon and Tom McCan
J-Ski is the box, farmers is the street
Signing hungry-over-beasts that's why I always eat
Up to you to guess whose rockin' the funky sound
If you don't know never mind come on and get down

Callin me a sucker boy you're pushin a broom
If you try to pull a ace you'll get a punch in the face
All eyes are on my posse when we walk in the place
Got a (???) family from my happy days
Not the boys that play the bench for the Oakland A
He drop you to a hop to the record he play
Couldn't keep it a secret I'm L.L. Cool J

He used to Smurf now you're jackin cause my name's on the map
Sit and lie my homeboy Earl says is that he loves hats
With a hands like a hatcher, Cut Creators in bat
Cut Creator on the fader the teachers pet
Baddest man with ten fingers you've ever met
And sooner or later we'll have to sit

Got a can full of jams pullin off the lid
Competition in New York is doin' what I did
Cold sender of a story I paid my dues
I rocked at house parties I was down with crews
Now I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's
And for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes
I scar like stones hard like cement and I rocked every jam that I ever went
'Cause I got a better reppin than any emcee has
And I'm down like a brother from Alcatraz

So I'm makin' big steps like Gladys Knight in the pier
One rhyme you're on my tensils as I leave my lip
Up the block kids are talkin' and spreadin the news
About the new grandmaster the one you'll choose
'Cause I'm chuckling I wanna stomp the rest
When I kick it couldn't bore it could only impress
I'm not a Hula-Hoop this isn't a passin phase
Hard work pays I'm gettin' straight up A's
Cool J is runnin' things I want it understood
Executioner I should wear a black hood
And carry an axe 'cause I'm ruff on wax

Cinderfella Dana Dane,Dana Dane,Rap,"Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
'We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!'
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, 'Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits'
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, 'Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess'
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said 'Step-dad, may I?'
And before I could finish, 'Hell no!', he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
'We can and you can't' is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, 'Clean up this place!'

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Well I shrugged, I hissed, 'They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish'
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, 'What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish'
I said, 'Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest'
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, 'One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self'

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, 'Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!'

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' 'Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be'
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
'Who is it?', that's what my brothers barked
'The princess', this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' 'No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief'
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, 'Is this the one you're referring to?'
Well she said, 'Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?'
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, 'I've got to go'
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry...

Slick talk to the track,
C'mon who brought that,
To the game,
Graffiti all on the train,
Get up your name,
I don't feel how I used to feel,
I'm in my 20's,
So a new Nas joint used to give me the chills,
In the barbershop tryin' to cop a new hot tape,
The Rob Lowe's is crazy,
The duhops greatest, Hip Hop (Hip Hop)
And yes I'm a fan first,
If you from the south and you snap till your hands hurt,
If you from the west W's in the air,
If you from the east coast act like you from here

The classic head nod,
The thirsty ice grills
Who wants to get robbed?(robbed)

The tides come in and the earth shakes,
200 mph wind I'm your worst fate,
Birthdate,
July 6,1980,
How can your age even matter when you rhyme this crazy,
Awww, man, I gotta think the lord,
'Cause with this pen in my hand,
I don't think that hard,
It just happens,
Wrist action classic in the making,
I kick back, and just laugh I'm happy that I'm amazing,
Look at me, gaze into my eyes, see the poverty,
Now understand why me and this music gotta be,
It's something that's inside of me,
And I can't shake it,
So I embrace it,
And let y'all taste it"

Vroom vroom vroom

My mind is racing

When you young you talk shit and get slapped up for it
The ice, the cars, the clothes, we already bought it
The streets, the projects, the hood, we already support it
The rep, the respect, them cases we already carted
The gold, the platinum plaques, we already flaunted
The leathers in freezing weathers we already sported
The wise see your lies and you already shorted
Them boys they talkin' to boys, we men we ignore it
The whole planet, so-called Earth, we already toured it
My levels be on max with the bass distorted
When the economy is up we getting all of that
When the economy is down we still touring Jack
Look back at '88, where them ballers at?
They was buyin' out the bar, I ain't fall for that
Spending they money, you'd think the club would call them back
But they didn't, that shit was all an act

In this concrete jungle it's hard to stay humble
I'm a warrior

I bring that drama to whoever, whenever, WHAT!

Yo, let me tell you 'bout defeating the drama
In the street with the armour
It's the teacher, Kris Parker
I be in the hood, looking good, speaking of honour
Being a father
Not avoid the baby mama drama
Respect myself I gotta, we gotta live proper
The True hip-hopper, hits yes a non-stopper
A no quitter, heavy hitter
Looks within to, be the winner
Now let us begin the orientation
Hip-hop culture is what we call the nation
But annihilation is what we facing
Cats getting killed from Scott La Rock to Jam Master Jason
That's why we was at the United Nations
Laying down the foundation
For hip-hop as a real nation
You know what time we wastin?

Live and direct, respect it to the underground connect
Pah! I'm wreckin any MC you select
Yo E, load me in your gun, light the flares
Give me forty-eight bars, and I go out like gays at Billy Bear
Wear and tear, I'm wreckin for the Bricks is where
Jump in my way and get your body splattered everywhere
Conjunction junction what's your function
It's that nigga who's so swift I could lose a compass
Step into jams, with seven niggaz in a Land
And forty motherfuckers in some fucked up caravan
Drop the farenheight back down to zero
Bring Heat to the streets like I'm Pacino and DeNiro
Raw dog material, grand imperial
Talk to my shotty nigga, my ears ain't hearin you

So take heed to what I'm saying
Cause tonight's the night, and me and my nuccas ain't playing

Now do I look crazy? Deranged, maybe?
You shot first, your glock burst, but it graze me
Now time for lyrics, put up your guns
And watch me get this shit hoppin like the West was won
Got that lyrical chicken feed, for all chicken heads
Crowd your Rap City committee, like I'm (Big Leads)
Most bigger than them Melendez brothers
You need Cochran when you're fuckin' with Judge Red
Put your fingers up if you love hash and cash
I been that way since Ike Turner was kickin Tina ass
Hookers ridin' dick, like I'm a motorcycle
You wanna shine bitch? Let me simonize you
I make sure your vision blur, till you don't know what occurred
Until I black out every nerver
Foul women get served as chicken head hors d'ouerves
I drop your tops like your heads was convertibles!
Hah, if you still look up in the sky I'm still high
All the way live like Lakeside
Wann die? E (whattup son), you got this beat pumpin
The way I feel niggaz ain't leave until they up in somethin'
Pack my dutch like the niggaz in the county

Up around them big butt freaks is where you find me

Don't stop, the body rock... aoowwwwwowwwww

I started spittin', that's why the brick niggaz be lickin'
They stay on magazine written equipments
And lyrics I got 'em by the shipment, where your bitch went
I'm smokin' leaky out the Lec-y, fatal
My Squad steps with the ultimatum, true dat
My muzak, move crowds, like down the hill moved crack
For those who stepped on toes, I want my shoes back
Buddy, bringin' money to your girl
For your little daughter like I'm Cutty
Twenty dollars a pop to dub me, I bug G, quote it
I see you notice how I leave microphones corroded
Hahahahaha, your staff not up to par
You raw, you're more like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Call deep niggaz, keep the gas pedal floored
And I pump the funk to keep a room and board

Til The End,Lloyd Banks,Rap,"Nobody dead knew they would die before they woke
It probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last night's pussy the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin from a nightmare mind on a c-note
You leave the door open of intensions of fulfillin your visions
Constantly sidetracked thinking about who's your man and who isn't
Maybe its necessary... maybe you're overreacting
Maybe your actual downfall is that hole that you clappin
Maybe ya pullin conversations that are controllin ya actions
Maybe your homie overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corna
Cause death has promised ya you seen some niggas go before ya
N' threats are honest... n with that lingering in the back of ya head
Ya know it's possible that you won't make back in ya bed
The confusion of jealously and dishonor'll spin ya
But there's nothing that hurt worse then when that gun powders in ya

If you my nigga you my nigga till the end (whoa)

The smell of marijuana reeks off me
I raise hell before I speak softly
Caught in the mix
Put at least a hundred grand on one and bought him a six
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man he taught him to fix
We ain't never left the hood so we cam corded the trips
I've done watched a nigga go from BET to the bricks... shit
Her slanted eyes with ya chocolate Thai gave me
I'm a bachelor... nigga you ain't knockin' my lady
A lot of these niggas been jockin mine lately
N' I hope you catch the long nap, rock-a-bye baby (gun shot)
When 2 brothers, pushed outta different mamas
Close enough to conflict or put this shit behind us

Remember back then with lines 'n' ya flattop
Hoping ya moms ain't the mama on crack rock

I keep my mind on my money and my head to the sky
I never really smile much if you was here you'd know why
There's frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin' me up, right hookin my high
Niggas hated on us before the game took us inside
Then they opened their arms wide took the whooping' 'n' cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin' on the wall in my crib
And handsome is one of the things they've been callin the kid
They watch you close when you coppin all those VS stones
If you ain't tryin' to get it poppin' leave the BS home
I've got us a ditty broad that gives thee best dome
And I'm blowin' on some of the finest weed that's grown... homes
You won't know when they gon' dump a slug
But you can tell I'm getting money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up, u can't compare the doe
And if its only one bitch don't even share a hoe

Inner world wisdom
Temporarily all the voice filled in
Light shining in the places that we're real 'an
Real 'nd body mind 'n' spirit building
Delivering a scalping to a pilgrim
And throw a pow-wow when an indigenous man
Return to present through the womb of a big pen
Slipping back out is all of me I will be slipping
I'm on a journey to a whole other dimension
The deeper that I get I'm leaving comprehension
Envision a blur life is but a big spin
A music auras is another way you glimpsing

Even in the hard times
Feeling precious suddenly I feel the god-mind
I design put me back 'n' line acting fine
If life is prison then the music is the yard time
It's all fine put my anger in a world rhyme
You won't forget 'em even if you step with alzheimer
From outta nowhere to the earth so call me ball guy
My big eye has the vision of my small eyes
It's from the heart so for that I won't appologize
It ain't me anyway it's coming from the all-wide
Raw hide dig in deep into the archive
No matter what I gotta hit it where the ball lies
At all times

Go around come around
Come on now homeward bound show 'em how
Growing now cop blow 'em down hold 'em down
Throw it down much wholer now
Slow it down I'm low 'n' brow

Fold 'er now woven vow chosen style

B Side Wins Again,Public Enemy,Rap,"So here we go y'all
Little by little you know

And the knowledge to move 'em
And still rock

Feel the load on your brain for the episode
And we just begun, it's number one y'all
Brother Black, the B is back
So check it out

And 'ya don't, I won't, if 'ya still, I will
Take 3 jams and hold 'em, this what I told 'em
To rock the other side, the sucker lied
Said he would shock but never tried, and so I
Took 'em away, I never stayed y'all
Called the Flavor Flav to make another record
To get played
He made a jam to get you stammed
Back to back in the place where the suckers are basin'
Whatever it takes to make it hardcore
We gonna roll it raw
That's what you but it for, c'mon
You roll in your ride, the DJ decides
To play it on the radio
The A side
He gives it a try
But never gives it a try
And the people request the best
On the B side

Food for the brain, beats for the feet
People on the dance floor
Never claimin' a receipt
Had a good time rockin', rollin' on the go rhyme
The rhythm supplied by the superior B side
They had to twist and turn and shout
Turn the jam out, getcha' ready now, c'mon
The situation put you in
To where you're sweatin' in
Hysterical B side, c'mon inside
Request the best to give a test
And never give a rest
Your guess is good as my guess
And while I'm guessin' your guessin', yo listen this is...
A DJ to play to give a lesson
And his name is Terminator X

And the sucker on the right gets cynical
'Cause the record's to the left and political
And you search the stores
Attack the racks with your claws
For the rebels without a pause
'Cause the B side
Wins again, again, again
Yo Black, some of you are all in
To make sure the crowd
Get loud wit' it on the dance floor
'Cause the B is pure sure
You never knew the crowd was this hype
But you thought we was that type
To start a riot, we ain't quiet
Kickin' a thunderstorm with a song
Why would we dare you to come along
Pump up the music, pump the sound
Once again we gonna do it like this now
And while I'm throwin', you're goin'
And you know it's time for man on a mission
To listen 'cause he's in the house
He's Terminator X"
Da Art Of Storytellin' (Part 2),OutKast,Rap,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo

Baby did you hear that? Yeah baby, I heard it too
Look out the window, golly the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dyin' and cryin' because of you
Rainin' cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue

Silly mortals haven't a clue
As to what the fuck is goin' on
I'm on the telephone, dialin' the Dungeon
""Hello?"" This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the earth and travel carefully

Baby grab the baby 'cause baby there ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossin' and turnin' and that's our sign
Omega Nigga IFO's are landin' in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head but if so you will catch on later

Play the track, guess she could not take it anymore
Rapin' her heavenly body like a hoe, coochie sore
From niggas constantly fuckin' her, never lovin' her
Never showin' appreciation, bustin' nuts in her face when they done

The sky is fallin', nobody ballin', they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs but the Hornets they won
Nigga we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing at the house 'cause I knew they'd try to ram me

But I'm stabbing
Makin' a path on expressways, the best way I know how
Up in the sky, East-West, no clouds
Him comin' now, fuck that money now, I ask my honey how
She feeling and is Jordan okay, yeah yeah she's chillin'

We should be in the Dungeon shortly
Ain't nobody on they porch see
Approachin' the final exit
I'm thinkin' I see four horsies but I don't though
Nigga you won't know, until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California

All the weed smell like ammonia
But at the Dungeon, I know they smokin'
Writin' the raps and doin' the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

(All's well, nothing's well)
(All's well, nothing's well)
(All's well, nothing's well)

Ch-Check It Out,Beastie Boys,Rap,"All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to dis, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud

Blowin' doors off hinges
Grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with the needle nose pliers

Like Mutual of Omaha
With the ill boat you've never seen before
Gliding in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid

Like caprese with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfucking Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat, so whats up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check

So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that y'all and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out 
Let's turn this mother fucking party out

I said, Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission
He said, ""Son, you'd better listen.
Stuck in your ass is an electrician.""

Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rappin' Duke combined

Hey baby bubba, now what the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic and you won't see it later

'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up like a mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer 
I wear cotton but I don't wear deer

Shazam! and Abracadabra!
In the whip I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf

Light rays blazin'

Now, I go by the name of The King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy. Who moi?

I am the one with the clientele
You say, Ad-Rock, you rock so well
I've got class like Pink Champale 
MCA grab the mic before the mic goes stale

Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset yo, calm down
You look Cable Guy dunked off of your crown

I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap
But what you're making ain't hip hop B

Get your clothes right out the dryer.
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fressssshhhhhhhh attire 
Tonight we goin' out set the town afire

Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say,
""Those were the days.""

Nigga I'm weak-in, can't move my mouth to speak-in

But fucked up because my heart's still beatin'
I can't sleep, thinkin' how I'mma creep
Burners to squeeze but can't get up to help my ememies

Psychopath, when the days of wrath
Resolve the conflict, I'mma lick who did it
And who da fuck was wit it

Pumpin lead till them bastards ain't got no head

You could pray all day but still gone die anyway

Thankful for the times and memories they still alive

But things had changed ye moved away but who's to say

Musical Stampede,Looptroop,Rap,"Whatever I say over the beat it's a hit 'cause it's hot./ However I sound better believe that it's hip to the hop./ However you feel all my peops just lick off a shot./ Whatever you do Embee make sure the shit don't stop'

It's murder on the dance floor. Call the paramedics!
Right now, or you won't live to regret it.
Outline the whole crowd in chalk when I spit talk.
Slidin' through all the blood like a crip walk.
Yeah, a lame ass metaphor,
But say it better or shut the fuck up,
'Cause like my man said: It's all about who kicks the lamest shit,
And gets away with it. Fool.
In this rap I'm all about havin' some fun with it,
And burn till there's no return like capital punishment.
Promoe - on your FM dial,
With Looptroop - mother effin' styles.
From Sweden. Bleedin' all over the cut.
Female emcees I spread semen all over your butt,
Male emcees I knock out screamin' over you: What?
You must be dreamin' thinkin' you can fuck
With the Promoe - ahead of all heads,
The Promoe - a dread among bald heads.
With more hair and beard than you bargained for.
Don't f around 'cause my squad is raw.
It's Looptroop - the click is full proof.
Looptroop - too thick to shoot through.
Bullets bouncin' off the boulevard to the beat.
With my heart to the street man I'm hard to defeat.
Without Embee you ain't fuckin' with me.
Without 10 G's you ain't fuckin' with him.
Without him - no hits - you ain't makin' a fuckin' cent,
So fuckin' with us don't make no motherfuckin' sense motherfucker!

This goes out to all of those who been oppressed for too long
And don't know where they belong.
This goes out to all my people who had enough
Of the chains and handcuffs./ (x2)
All right we're smaller than you but we're more than you,
So we move faster, eat you whole before you shoot yo.
No time to gaze, bun them evil acts they do.
They know my face so run before they catch you too.
You don't want that, trust me, I've been to hell and back
But if you get caught remember to tell them that
This music don't back for nobody, retreat for nothin'
'Cause it's the pulse of all the people strugglin'
The lifeline for the hopeless, the eyes of the blind,
The underworld communication of our time
So rise and shine, they can't eliminate the messages.
Even if they kill us can't get us 'cause

Embee did it again! - Haters no like
But they gotta bounce to it 'cause the show's so tight
Turn up the volume till the beat make the vinyl skip!
No funny binniz, I repeat, we ain't signing shit!
Schlooks stay young and angry, horny, hungry, drunk and high
Sex junkies now...
But I, don't want no medecine, want you to let me in
Mamita call him, tell him that you found a better friend!
Your moms recommend, - You stay away from them!
But I don't blame you for kickin it with the champion.
From the dragons den - Waxkabinetten!
Spit fire at your management and tying up your president.
I represent DVSG'z, cop any previous release,
And recognize game, we feeding the streets
That musical stampede, follow my lead,
Put your fist up in the air, and let 'em know who we be!

What About Us?,Mr. Lif,Rap,"We're out of limit now, enough is enough, you're sitting on billions of dollars,
But what about us?
One government, one world motto,""in God we trust,""
But what about us?

I write my rap quotes on bank notes
And bank statements that don't make sense,
Around the time it's time for me to pay rent.
My patience is running out, the truth is coming out;
Abusive clout, CEO's using large amounts,
We could never dream of ???.
It's like we're in a war without a heater,
A broken-up casino staring at the dealer,
Light ya sensemilla.
They rush to lock you up for puffin on the stress reliever,
And Obama wouldn't stop 'em neither,
Would McCain? let me explain,
Got lost playing your game,
They pumped a couple of slugs in my frame.
Y'all all tax payer slayers, turn the other cheek,
To regulate us, trust-betrayers,
Reagan Nixon and Petreaus,
Poorly portray us, program us just to sway us,
Promise us favours, then use 'em just to dominate us,
Oh now you printin 700 billion just to save the children?
Y'all motherfuckers bound to make a killin'!

We're out of limit now, enough is enough, you're sitting on billions of dollars,
But what about us?
No health-care, just enough change to ride the motherfucking bus,
But what about us?
Our biggest mistake was giving you trust, you livin' plush,
'N you don't give a fuck about us.
One government, one world motto,""in God we trust,""
But what about us?

Is this in our best interest to infest the world with stress?
Just so you can dress best, I guess you answer yes,
As we linger at the precipice just to hear from dying, hear the crying,
That old couple with the hopes of retiring,
About to clap you with the iron, trying hard not to let go,
The goals they set from the get-go,
Lost they power in the price of petrol,
And now they patrol and so the story goes,
Death with no memorials, tutorials
On this don't exist, income tax is just a myth to make the bankers richer,
So they can sell you half the picture,
Then seize ya assets quicker than you can go acquire them,
We have the right to fire them, then say we're coconspiring
Through silence, through science, that's social
And economic, you manufacture our consent to make a profit.
The paper's been powerless since they left the gold standard,
They're using currency to rule the whole planet.

We're out of limit now, enough is enough, you're sitting on billions of dollars,
But what about us?
No health-care, just enough change to ride the motherfucking bus,
But what about us?
Our biggest mistake was giving you trust, you livin' plush,
'N you don't give a fuck about us.
One government, one world motto,""in God we trust,""

Now what's left?
Now what's left?"
Wanna Play Ruff,Nas,Rap,"Yo, the Lord is my shepherd, the sword is my weapon
Reward is a blessin' that comes from the struggle
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed
Another Mother loses a son

'Cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun
Before they choose an education
But once dead, their ain't no awakenin'
So like once said life ain't for fakin'

Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em? fuck waitin'
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan
When I aim, I ain't missin', master of assassination

I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo
Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves
With a chipped tooth is this the truth?
This is what we do, sip a brew

Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'

Okay, you wanna play rough?
A thug changes and love changes
A thug changes and love changes
A thug changes and love changes
Okay yo, we could play rough

Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck?
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat? Are they lookin' for me?

But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did?
May they rest in peace but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-11 glock spits 17 shot clips

Put these niggas in boxes where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat, back up in the street
Watch these niggas that's tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat

Empty every shell in their direction, it's you, I should've guessed it
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you don't know what you got into

Okay, you wanna play rough?
A thug changes and love changes
A thug changes and love changes
A thug changes and love changes
Okay yo, we could play rough

Walked in his house, smackin' him up, what you talkin' about?
He said, ""shut-up nigga"" Knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone

Fuckin' with me, you should've known
I'll have 'em write stupid nigga on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin' me

I'ma do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin' you niggas with nothin'
Left him dead, engine runnin'
You the only I'm makin' sure that gets what's comin'

Look at your woman, anal ripped out, it's your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live

Shit like that, in case a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like fam' and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats

Gettin' even's never wrong, it's only right to react
Eye for an eye 'cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat? a cop man, let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin

Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Don't explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew 'em before that I can't remember the last time I said
Okay, so we gonna play rough

Okay, you wanna play rough?
A thug changes and love changes
A thug changes and love changes
A thug changes and love changes
Okay yo, we could play rough"

'Cause my dick still gon' be swangin
You here those fuckin' choppers cuttin' niggas, run nigga!
Hike nigga, hut one, nigga want some?!
Ain't nuttin to fuck ya up, representin where I come from
Fronts and brown blunts, you oughta get down some
Recognize a fuckin' killa when you be around 'em
Valiums and speed but we don't do weed
Steroids and alcohol, still a fuckin' athlete
Cock strong with my jock strap on with the time clock
Bout to run the rock home
Yo' ace boom coon in the hole in the clutch
In the pocket on the field, without gettin' touched!

Chorus 2x: Uh oh here I come, here I go, uh oh, jump round jump!
Watcha wanna do?!
Watcha gonna do?!
Let me know girl, jump, jump!

You get tackled by the style I'm usin'
I got all of my adversaries cruisin for a brusin with contusions
Cuts and lacerations, broken bones, and open sores
Ripped spleens, sprained ankles, and broken nose
I'ma bust the microphones I rip on
I step on the stage and get my grip on
That's when you get stiff armed
It's on and I'm the shit homes!
I fucked around and lost count of bitches I put the dick on
My alter-ego and its cool when I talk to P
They fuckin' call me the home-town hero
I'm the center of attention, topic of the discussion
It's understood they already know without me sayin' nothin'
It's been like that since these niggas been down here wearin badges
I'm off the heezy, I'm the reason for this pimp rap!
So stuck on myself sometimes it's like I ain't got no mind
I say fuck it dawg and go for the crowd like the goal line!

Nigga you just like ten yards, always the first down
Be the first motherfucker off the bus but be the last nigga to clown
Ol' sometime ass nigga ol' fake regular regular,
Everyday common-ass no drama-ass nigga
I keep these niggas sippin on super dick and advil
Punishin they motherfuckin ass and keepin' it dat real

Watcha wanna do?!

Ghetto Dreams,Fat Pat,Rap,"Ghetto dreams baby
That's what we talking bout...

Ghetto dreams, diamond rings
Money hoes and clothes and all those, fancy things

(Fat Pat)
Money hoes, fancy clothes
Heavy in the game, so I'm hot as cold
For paper, wake me up I think I'm dreaming
Back in the game, I thought I'd never have these things
Bitches want a ring, Rolls and plenty green
Black lacquer screens, three story dreams
House on a hill, fantasies are built
Private jet sip Moet, Sacci set now a Vette
Doing 'bout a hundred-five, down the highway
Yellow bone on my side, sitting sideways
Independent women, should I say franchise
Right before your eyes, I'm going nationwide
Baguettes in my mouth, smoked like a cloud
Make my mama proud, cause ain't no holding out
On my dreams, yeah I'm gon get it
Win it like the Lotto, dressed in Amavado
Alligator shoe, when I smash on the throttle
Angry super model, paparazzi follow
Money hoes and clothes, it make my head hollow
I'm drinking out the bottle, to ride on my sorrow
A better day tomorrow, is all I wish for
A millionaire dream, plus a whole lot more
The country I'll explore, navigator
System guides my way, for the lyrical AK

(Fat Pat)
Stacks to be made, in the world gon get it
Opportunities come, a mile a minute
From start to finish, have big dreams baby
Coming down Mercedes, everybody's angry
Rapper or emcee, whatever you wanna call it
Credit cards or cash, we balling in the mall and
Hauling, three TV's in my load
Marble on my dash, got wood on my do's
Who knows, what the world unfold as it go
Round and round, I'ma keep putting it down
Endo pounds, getting sent from out of town
Me and my partna, in the kitchen breaking chickens down
Making plastic fried, whoa look at me now
I'm shining like the sun, Rolex dimaonds
Here I come here I come, top down in my Bentley
All my enemies looking, but come on get me

(Fat Pat)
This just the beginning, of a next episode
The game unfold, down a 24 karat road
To success, no settling for less
Strive to be the best, if I'm broke I can't rest
Mind full of stress, so I break for my dream
Like I'm running a marathon, and capalon hustle for me
And my son, my job is never done
It's like I'm one on one, me against the world
And it's hard to hold on, but I keep a tight grip
Write another song, drop it like it's hot no time to prolong
Get out the hood, was something like a dream
Whoever thought, Fat Pat would rap sing
Have all these things, I'll be just like a king
In your face one more time, just to let you know
Coming up is impossible, if you don't hustle
Trust no info, coming from the back
Cause haters come in all size and forms, and that's a fact
When I was growing up, I never got no slack
No handouts for Pat, had to grind for it black
I let my nuts hang in the game, pumped hard for it mayn
When it sleets no rain, I wanted big thangs
Plus a whole lot of what, pocket change
Don't knock Pat, coming down the boulevard true
Fantasies and dreams, I just came through"
Brave New World,The Foreign Exchange,Rap,"We got, single moms that can't afford to feed children
World War Three got planes flying into building's
Corrupt cops and robbers, thieves and politicians
They just keeping taking as the world keeps spinning

Just take a look around now
A long way from your MTV cribs
With your full speaker surround sound
Get ready for countdown
Just to get some benefits
My girl lied to them, people down town

It's funny how we start out cool but get corroded
By our quest for power and the people that behold it
We up one minute then down before you know it
With no preliminary warning or advanced notice

I guess that's the reason why our eyes can't focus
Can't afford to raise kids 'cause we gotta raise soldiers
And satellites, looking at my pad when I wrote this
A brave new world, y'all better know it

Been a lot of long days, a lot of nights traveling
A lot of niggaz asking, what record's 9th's sampling?
Lot of nights on stages, we forgetting the time and
A lot of in-stores and poster signings

A lot of cats after mines
But that's ain't even keeps me motivated half the time
I think of open mic nights when I would ask to rhyme
When I had something to prove and an axe to grind

Now we travel world wide full throttle
Scared to catch SARS so we canceled all the shows in Toronto
This rap shit ain't all about hoes and super models
It's more about me making this money to pay my condo

So our families can feed each other, these days
My friends are perfect strangers who'll never meet each other
Strong pounds and bear hugs when we greet each other
'Cause in this new world, I know we gonna need each other"

Fed Up Wit The Bullshit,Big L,Rap,"Yo, on the scene is the brother that's big, I'm not a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they ain't nothin' but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin' cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights, and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop, or I'ma stop em, by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me, muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin' life bids
Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip, 'cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up (Aw, shit)

Whether it's the hot, warm, cool or cold season
Pigs be fuckin' with a nigga for no reason
You're just gettin' home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin' jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up, and that's fucked up
This every day, not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin' the other cheek
Or you'll be layin in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin' nine glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm only fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin'
'Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick
'Cause I'm fed up with that bullshit"
Distortion,Rev Run,Rap,"(Rev Run)
I got a rhyme for the users, those they call losers
Those that got bruises, those they call useless
Blown they last fuses, fooled but not foolish!

I got a rhyme for the homeless, homes that's cold hopeless
Stoned and still dopeless, broke like the brokest
High and still potent, feel like the dopest
Straight from the dirt and hurt but still focused

Oopsy-daisy, they call him lazy
Amazin crazy, slave wages pays thee
Often tossed in, coughed off exhaustion
Now here comes distortion!

Now here comes distortion {*repeat 3X*}

(Rev Run)
Girls gone wildin, and profilin
14 but seen on the Island
Out for her man's and, they got plans in
Three years left with plans for a mansion
Credit card criminal, he got a minimum
But when he's out he's paid like nine, ten of 'em
She got a kid now, he wants abortion
Now here comes distortion!

3 Card Molly,C-Rayz Walz,Rap,"Word up, I ain't forget y'all, yeah Doug

(C-Rayz Walz)
Four to five times, dum-dums blast
In the chest of my brother, that breath was the last one
I don't believe it, my heart need a cast
I told him, GET OUT THAT LANE, cause it was too fast
Ain't it time to, cut these yellow lines, the
Show must go on I got his younger brother on my mind
Cash tragic, wish I knew magic tricks
I'd bring it back to the physical script
And dreams is broke, he got smoked for coke - in the form of rock
What it made worse, he was on his own block
At the funeral, I cried then laughed
At the same time, my wrath, had me happy and sad
To reminisce, off his unique funnyness
Adds up to this, his life was a gift
To be back, the memories from days of way back
Before, Crips or gats, colored tops and graf
We thought, bikes was fat, and girls was whack
They said you died black, but I don't believe that
'Member that time I took the shit in the train station
And you said the cops was comin', but you was just playin'
Right after we robbed that crackhead fams
That was back in the day, but DAMN
We both had the, high-top, fades like Kane and
We was fiendin for them Nike Airs on Fordham Road
It don't make sense, how you was gone
And it don't make rent, how I don't get paid for this song
But it make rent, in my pocket when I pull 'em out
And it make me, wanna go and... yo
I feel like blastin myself, cause my pops is gone
This ain't nothin' goin' on, but the stocks and bonds
Lost in the ocean of life, provokin the strife
Couldn't see the day, with the motion of night

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Off on the road, 3 card molly
Fuckin' up the icey man in front of everybody
BX, the place I was from
BX, man I loved that slum

And Ms. Rios, sorry that I dissed your flag
And when Ty got shot, he had to shit in a bag
But that's okay, cause Ra lay, on the same corner
On the same ave, where I sold, marijuana
And Ms. Carolyn, was a nosy neighbor
Mr. Sack was screamin loud, but that was the days
Of a angry sick juvenile, mentality
Not nice on the mic, but niggaz ain't wanna battle me
Cause the knuckle game was Chuck Norris
The gun was enchanted, enterin a buck-buck forest
Without the dollars, more lies that Morris
You know how it go, for con artists
I remember block parties and, 22's
And light and serious and, a funny crew
And Jabu I miss you, when you died I was upset
Couldn't know how it felt, to be a Vietnam vet
To hear bombs goin' off in your ear, with big Metallica
And now we in the streets and the jails is like Galaga
They got your DNA sample
Plus they got your female in the house trampled
{*Sounds*} is the hell of the train station
I try to move out, leave the pain vacant
But it stay here, and it stays there
Bust out, stray shots, there's no fear"

Here we go again with the funky intro
People approach me knowin' I'm the Prince Po
E-t, r-y, and I'm the first batter
The Pharaoh usually go first, but it don't matter
Funky slices of beats like this
Comes once in a blue, but it's not hard for me to chew
So kick off your shoes and don't forget your socks
I wash and wash them emcess like Clorox
Skills I have, good and plenty
If you want dope lyrics but still gimmicks gimme
Beats, equivalent to just something that I can
Flow (flow) flow (flow) FLOAT ONnnnnn
It's gettin' heavy so heavy and keep ya coat on
When I, proceed to, light the party
In the summer, somethin' like a Mardi, Gras
Bikinis, panties, bras
Juicin 'em and I'm suckin the girls up like straws
OOPS upside ya dome
I don't answer the phone when I'm home not alone
On the bone
Leave your name and your number and a brief message at the end of the tone
BOOP!
Ooh, and I like it
'Cause I'm Poetry the psychic
Intellectual level would rather
Nah, nah I don't like that

Rollin' lyrics, off the tip of my tongue (swing)
I swing (swing), I swang (swang), I swung (swung)
Bringin' you the news like Kaity Chung
But I'm not a pretty oriental specimen from
'Hong Kong Fooey, numba one supa guy'
I love the women but I don't try to see em
I'd rather make the money bein on the cover of E.M.
Get MCs mad make 'em flare up nostrils
I'm Poetry the rap fanatic I get hostile

Verse Two: Pharaoh Monch

Pressure presssure pressure pressure pressure pressure cooker
I leave the party when I mass a lot of hookers
Slip and slide, I slid the sludge
(Fudge) fudge (pudge) pudge, but I never hold a grudge
Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs
(The organism's on the jury) guess who's the judge
I hit the hook HEAVY
Ready no chitter-chatter I figure since I'm bigger why pitter-patter
Props in no particular poetry persists to pertriculate?
You're just a pussy (MEOW)
Cat when I'm deckin you
Disrespectin you
Clever whenever I select a new dialogue
One plus one get it together
Girls don't despair 'cause I'll be your 'Fair Weather Friend'
No I don't have a Benz and no I don't have an Infiniti
I figure the eight inches of ME, will be the remedy
'Cause when I pull up to the bumper
'Cause I'll be down to thump a girl like Heather Hunter
I tell you now you never hated
The triple X when it comes to sex is what I'm rated
I tell you know that I can give good love
Yes I'm the one you should love
So don't try to diss fudge pudge
'Cause it's al-right, with, me'

No Nuts,Hieroglyphics,Rap,"(Del)
Del meister, bout to heist the hijacking, come back
Listen to this, peep it

The transfixer, reprimand your bland fixtures
Replenishing with my menacing sentencing
Up inside this, oblige with guidance
From the funk expanding verb triton
I glance upon the multitudes of weak and seek
To organization concentration camps so they can get lobotimized
Fuck so bad, you feel sodomized
Time for words to be colonized
To keep regards tall in size
Erecting the best things in life
My flows composed of foe-sas
My enemies cheese in my face and embrace my palm
I hella spurn, but my face is calm
Keeping the hip-hop scene vibrant
I come alive with good tide, it's fine, and MC's silent
Milestones in Hiero history
Led you wishin' we was never released, at least
Even if our demo tapes add to the myth of Hiero's gifts
Those that don't agree is just pleading the Fifth
Proceeding to enscript the code
That makes your brain overload and implode
Too much imagination got you facing defeat
Quit rhyming cause to wasting the beat
It's Del with my diabolical follow-ups
And logged to augmentated tales that keep you mind tensing
With interest, and that was just an entrance

Save it, put it in your pocket for later
It's all greater, I'ma do you a small favor
Deliver want we call beta
For y'all and your neighbors
With Del on the mic, and Rob on the fader
Wait up, hold up, Hiero got it sewed up
You know butt, Del is coming through with the cold cuts
Competition shouldn't have even shown up with No Nuts
We robust, Del is coming through with the cold cuts

(Pep Love)
The coldcuts
Make the whole planet panic and when it blows up
I hit'em again and again
Trust no one
The Hieroglyphic mics have been descrated by the likes of them
And I don't know about that diplomatic shit
I rather let it just crank when niggas be on the dick like a nympho
I murder'em like hurdling obstacles
It cause holocaust, all I got is word and balls
I'm hot pepper, that you don't wanna taste to see
So just watch me lace the beat gracefully
And ain't a nigga got a thang to say
My broken language slay niggas that came this way
Aimlessly
My automatic's spray reck havoc and mayhem
If you got something to say, come to bay
And get it off your chest
Then put it to rest
Another competitor bested
Ready to, just shut the hell up
Develop your skill, and get enveloped still
With my nigga Del up, to bat turn, yellow belly, and lilly livered
We delivered the Russian roulette
You never know it might get you wet
I'll make a issue out of that bitch, you turned to diss (WHO)
Thee invincible, Hieroglyphics crew,
I'll grab that ass by that braid and shock you like Raiden
Wash you mouth out with dick, and keep skating pass
The irrelvant punk that pump fiction
But no, he don't want no friction
I got a mic addiction that I don't wanna kick
Mine's are original rhymes that are three-dimensional
Inching up to the pinnacle and cranking my engine up
And then I'm out with the middle finger up
And a perpetual ""S"" on my chest, just to let you know
We still the best

Save it, put it in your pocket for later
It's all greater, I'ma do you a small favor
Deliver want we call beta
For y'all and your neighbors

If I May,Blackalicious,Rap,"[Erinn Anova] (Chorus)

Come along and reap
I need my song
We're climbin' over
Beneath the sea
March on
Time is almost gone
It's all in me
No maybe

(Gift Of Gab)
Here we go again
Slip into my conscience, come along an take in
A story 'bout a battle, in this corner, Satan
Cunning, baffling, and jumping into half the drink
And suddenly disasters and catastrophe
And acting unrationally
Reacting savagely
To passionately
Bask in everlasting like escapes from just what its creating
Jeopardizin' love
Look at all the people that you took advantage of
See your hypnotized
Rom be gone, take another cup
In consequences lurk
While the reaper got your shirt size
Nigga wack up
Times overdue for the birth of a power that the universe grew from

(Gift Of Gab)
You search for the answers outside
Refocus causin' time and time again, backslide
You've noticed times before the presence of that ""I""
But never did submit to it and let it apply
Whatever be his will in this present life time
Or essence like mine
Know the blessings you might find
If you let your higher power inside
Emerge and apply to every single thing in your balance
You will truly find
Who you really are
Die and become reborn
When God is present in your life than you can come reap on
And ain't a storm that you can't weather
You got a purpose you was born to create
Destiny is waitin' for you
Arms open, take with ya
Knowledge bestowed by the great giver
Lakes, rivers
Mountains and steams
Now reality's the dream wraitha
No more searchin' for truth that was always wit' cha
It had to hit ya through the struggle and the turmoil
Ya soul was planted and it sprouted out above soil
And let the sun shine freely down
At times it looked like it wouldn't
But the plant came to flourish
Now it's standin' on solid ground

(Lateef)

Sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head above the ed if I could be

(Lateef and Erinn Anova)

The sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head up

That's how we groove it's how we sway
That's how we sway it's how we groove

Contained in a universe
Residing in my inner
Magnificent view
Of cornmeal stew
And calaloo
Got me wooning on the strongbone
Totty we loved them
Send them come
Roopapiffpum
Live wire we runnin' it
Shock stun stunning it
No pun in it
You see crusties drum drumming it
Roots of the faith
Trace back to year dot
We squat up in the ritz
Then we rip it down brick by brick
'Cause we's a sick sick sick
Extension of clique
French kissing the chaos
In a parallel hell
Imploded terror
They got my future on DVD
Intriguing as it be
I don't really wanna see
That the kind of su'um
That sound strange to me
There's chocolate splashed on the floor
Look like voodoo
Shite somebody splashed me with doodoo

Roots mawhoda? Kickin the cack
Roots mawhoda? Kickin the cack

Zibadoo etc

Known to spit roots raps
Over stripped down tracks
Travel over foreign
Get drunk and act slack
Wild as fuck
While we's living in a pack
If it wasn't for this hip hop shit
Would I sell crack
Can you answer my questions
Tell me how black is black
Ain't no land in the motherland
Be takin' me back
With my five GCSEs and one OND
Didn't quite make it to university
Scratched on for how long
Scum of the scum
In the belly of the beast
Where we fight for crumb
We on the psychospiritual
Psychophenomenal
Transit
Speaker of the unsaid shit
Just a speck of dust
On the tip of god's dick
With a dick of my own
I zone across the hemisphere
Skanking on my toe tip
Make my lip shake
Levitate
As I eat carrot cake
Educated in the cycle of life
Unicycling on tightropes
Much too much for skid valley
Look at me
Ya wee bonnie lass
Decked out in adidas
She loves me for me
'Cause she got she own cash

That's how we groove it's how we sway

The Struggle Continues,Looptroop,Rap,"Check it
Everyday you give your more to receive your less (Why?)
I know it's hard to believe that mess (So)
When you get home and you feel depressed (Just)
Put on my tape and relieve the stress
And yo, cut the system, let it bleed to death
Ain't nothing but your mission, never leave your quest
In pole position, speed up, lead the rest
They don't need to rest, they need to see we blessed
Yo, life is like a tide, shit come and it goes
Somebody had to cry 'cause somebody wanted it so
You have to fight to feel the harmony flow
But it's hard when the light's both so far and so close

So when you fed up and you tired of life
Keep your head up, you'll reach higher heights
Yo, get up for the time is right
My people step up and shine your light

'Cause all of the trouble we've been through
And all of the evil that men do
It makes us harder, the struggle continues
Come on my sisters and brothers and sing too
Feel how the harmonies link you
While the struggle continues
We got so many things to
Say and do now

I know that life hurts, we all need a night nurse
I need to write words, I need the right words
To come across and make you feel my thirst
Without this so called freedom of speech I might burst
Transform the pain into a tight verse
Sending a shout out to all the freedom fighters
Throughout the whole U-N-I-verse
Winning this struggle unless we die first
Yo, when you hurt so much that it's hard to speak
And it hurts so much you can hardly breath
You wanna get up and fight but you're far too weak
Feels like a too long night for your heart to beat
They wanna kiss and make up but talk is cheap
You'd like to dis 'em straight up 'cause you're scarred too deep
Don't be fooled, recognize the mark of the beast
Stay true to yourself and you'll be hard to beat

'Cause all of the trouble we've been through
And all of the evil that men do
It makes us harder, the struggle continues
Come on my sisters and brothers and sing too
Feel how the harmonies link you
While the struggle continues
We got so many things to
Say and do now

I've seen so many different faces, different places
I've seen so many people struggling no matter the ages
From your grand dads grand dad to newborn babies
The answer that they giving is all the same old phrases
I've seen the pain gone away with medication
And dirty syringes in dirty stair cases
I've seen lives slaughtered by dictators
Nowadays nothing is news 'cause nothing amazes
I've seen so much that is hard to write
But it seems that's just a part of life
And the people who make us apologize
Is the same who make people starve tonight
And when your mind sees no difference between wrong or right
And your life sees no difference between dark or bright
And when not waking up is your only spark of light
Remember, we got a war to fight

So when you fed up and you tired of life
Keep your head up, you'll reach higher heights
Yo, get up for the time is right
My people step up and shine your light

'Cause all of the trouble we've been through
And all of the evil that men do
It makes us harder, the struggle continues
Come on my sisters and brothers and sing too
Feel how the harmonies link you
While the struggle continues
We got so many things to
Say and do now

The struggle continues till it suddenly hits you
The biggest one is the struggle within you
Kill out the hate that is bubbling in you
Before your mental poverty ends you
Can you hear us

All the trouble we've been through
All the evil that men do
Struggle continues
Come on and sing too
The harmonies link you
And the struggle continues
So many things to
Say and do now
So many things to
Say and do now"

Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no

Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry

Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's, and they looking like Halle Berry's

We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug

And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive? I know you paid

I'm An American (feat. B-Real of Cypress Hill),La Coka Nostra,Rap,"(John F. Kennedy)
To a new generation of Americans...

(Richard Nixon)
I must put the interest of America first. People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. I am NOT a crook...

(Slaine)
...I'm an American

(Charles Manson)
He United States of America is the demon of the world

(Slaine)
I'm a product of America, youth psychotic from narcotics
Born consumers and STD's, yeah I got it
A victim of a media machine, violence and lust
Top to bottom and greedy in between
I'm a menace with big dreams
And no morals to stop me from nuttin'
I gotta get mine, that's why I went and copped me a gun
Police would put me in a cage if they could lock me in one
These dudes would kill me out of jealousy; they'd pop me and run
Shit, I'm bloodthirsty too-- we were raised with foul ways
It's in everything we watch and listen to nowadays
And the younger kids are way more depraved
With a hunger for beef, some'll run around the neighborhood crazed
Land of the free, home of the brave-- my world is a morgue
One day I'll lay alone in a grave, still my dome is enslaved
In the haze of the power I crave
I can't help it, this is how I was raised
(I'm an American)

(Ill Bill)
My synergy's a conspiracy, I hit the scene like spinning guillotines
Villains creep through your village deep while idiots sleep
I'm awake, dominate, annihilate, I violate
Obliterate, incinerate, exterminate, I'm an American
Murder, hate, violence and war, tyrants galore
Riots and more, a violent uproar, the rise of the poor, we monitor all
Everybody signed at the door
So walk out now or you may never survive at all
We murder capitals, turn hometowns to homicides
TNT tinted Econolines
My take on society's beyond the fabrications that they prophesized
Colonize through modern lies
Economize and sodomize
Humanity everyday, vanity scrape
Gravity take hold of your sanity, wait
This is not an exercise, this is real life
Salvage your fate, contaminated planet of hate
The children sing a passage of faith
Lavish taste was a trait of Alexander the Great
Savage grace gravitate to mathematics and space
Like Dr. Malachi when the hidden cameras invade
Get shafted and played like the others these cannibals ate
(I'm an American)

(Everlast)
America! America! God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea
(Ill Bill)
I need a blowjob and a pizza
I'm an American

(Everlast)
Ay yo, my gluttonous nature is imperialistic
I'm completely irrational, I'm unrealistic
Got the right to talk shit, got the right to bear arms
I bring disease, I bring famine with some guns and some bombs
Got my four-horse squad, my lightning rod
I'm in a beef with the Devil, not a fight for God
I'm from the Highland clans, I'm on some stolen lands
The crown jewel in the New World Order plans
Get your quarter cam, place your order, man
Step up right this way to slaughter, lamb
While every one of y'all's freedoms got emancipated
You just surfed on the net and you masturbated
We got hoes, we got thugs, we got sex, we got drugs
We got laws, we got all the right people to break 'em
We got blood, you got oil, you got land we can spoil
We got bigger, better guns, yo I know we can take 'em

(B-Real)
Once upon a time in America
There was a hustler holding a Derringer
Wearing a black hoodie and living life like the predator
Hated this life, embarrassed of being alone
The little he knows will get him a past
Assed out with his head blown
It's no living, the land of the lost
Could've been a leader but put on the cross
Needed to push for his cause
Breaking laws, now he's a felon
The system is flawed
Praying to God every day of this life fighting the odds
He wants a piece of the pie, the gleam's in his eye
American dream in his mind, led him astray in his stride
Inside of a cell, he put his whole family through hell
Broken apart, breaking his mother's heart
He started in school when he was on the path to losing his mind
Whatever happened to, ""No Child Gets Left Behind""?
Just another slogan I'm hoping that you can comprehend
I'm born to struggle
(I'm an American)

And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea

Yo, that's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging
Orangutaning
Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act
Like I'm too famous
To say hi and tell 'em what My Name Is
But really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet do you?
Kill or not
Platinum or flop
I'll still put it through you
With a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher
Than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal with you in front of St. Andrew's still
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that road you pack
You gon' see these Runyan Ave. niggas

To show that ask the others
Brigade'll lay you down
Next to your mother's mother's grandmothers

You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight
And half the niggas I give DAT to

The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it

I'll kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You and yo' madam
It's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyselves screaming about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off of mere talent
My skills are deeply imbedded
Even your hoe said it
She was knock-kneed
I fucked her now she bow-legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping
Kuniving Kon Artis my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh

You asked for it

Everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas think I'm fronting (what up now?)
Then they change stories
I catch you and they thinking everything's hunky dory
I even have you pour me the gasoline for me (do it)
Pulling up slowly
Cop tailing your homies
Met a lot of niggas but you wouldn't wanna know me (for real)
Your ass might not even make it home with your roley (nigga)
Don't even try
In your system like eco lie
Trying to beef with me
Nigga please, your people die
I'm so wicked that my momma gave birth illegally (uh huh)
I survived the abortion immediately (Surprise!)

(Eminem)
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
When the *cops* come knocking
Each hands got one
Cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
One man army
Guns can't harm me
Young and ornery
Worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flip at censorship
Your friends just flipped
Over this swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I been giving it a hundred and ten percent
'Cause when I vent most of my energy's
Spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is hennessy
And twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten is because I love being under your skin
Ya, (shit) shit can happen
So stick to rapping
Quit the yapping
Or I'ma lift the mac in
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap
Get the can of whoop ass cracking

(Outro: Eminem)
(Shit can happen)
It can and it will
(Shit can happeeen)
Fuck around with Amityville
(Shit can happen)
And you die
Insanity still
(Shit can happeeen)
Mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies
(Shit can happen)
With their personality split
(Shit can happeeen)
Fucking you up with hit after hit
(Shit can happen)
Sticking you up with clip after clip
(Shit can happeeen)
Making you suck dick after dick
(Shit can happen)
(Shit can happeeen)
Dirty motherfuckin dozen
(Shit can happen)
The Kon Artis
(Shit can happeeen)
Motherfuckin Peter S. Bizarre
Swifty McVeigh

Puttin' you down in the cemetery

We are not playing

Love Lockdown,Kanye West,Rap,"I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose, you lose
You lose
You lose
You lose"

DJ Slice, tear me up baby, tear me up
This heah for my grandma mayne
I love you baby
The whole family miss you baby
I'm fin' ta tell the world, how important you was to me

(Chorus: Mike Jones)
Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
The way you used to hold me - the way you used to hold me
The way you used to show me - the way you used to show me
Befo' you left you told me - befo' you left you told me
That I was gonna have to keep the family up
(Mike Jones!)

(Mike Jones)
April 14th was when, I felt I lost a friend
I damn near stopped rappin', damn near stopped pimpin' pens
Cousin locked in the pen, when will this drama end
I get success but it feels like my stress begins
At 17 thought I was grown, had to move on
Moved out T. Jones home, had to do this on my own
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
'Cause she ain't here with me, but I know she hearin me
Beg and plead, that she could still be here next to me
Even though you passed and left, yo' memories are kept
In my mind, heart, and soul - even on my shelf
Now I'm left with cousin Shelly, Jessie, and they real, and Gary
(?) And my brother, Uncle June, and my mother and
Even though sometimes I get too busy to touch you
From me to y'all I want y'all to know I love you

Grandma remember when we used to play them bones and you would skunk us
And you never had a problem punkin us in front of company
Wally just had a son - he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Wally just had a son - he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Latran playin' ball, I pray to God he goes pro
And Gary Jr. gettin' bigger, I just thought I'd let you know
That the family's okay, everythang's cool and straight
Juanita and Nicky just told me to tell you they said hey
And I pray day to day that the Lord'll pave the way
And you keep lookin' down here just smilin', just showin ya pretty face
And I still hang around my homies that you see while you were here
Oh and my girl better than ever, she too wish you was here
You know I'm grown now, so I'm puttin' food on the table
24 years old and I got my own label
Ice Age Entertainment, we about to take it over
T. Boy rappin' now - he's Mellow, and Wally is Lil' Soldier
(?) Still rolls with me, we close shoulder to shoulder
That gator that you gave my granny I use it to sew the game up
Me and (?) was partners, we both now CEO's
It's all good but I wish you was able to see me grow

To use that, y'knahmsayin? 'Cause they gon' regret what they did to me
Y'knahmsayin? So I started usin' it, and it worked, y'knahmsayin?
And... it's it's just crazy mayne y'know?
I started sayin' my name a lot - y'knahmsayin?
I started givin' my phone number out - y'knahmsayin?
When people was tellin' me that it wasn't gon' work
My grandma was tellin' me to do it, y'knahmsayin?
She told she seen a vision and, that's a hell of a vision y'knahmsayin?
And... really I started givin' out my album, I started promotin it and
All the stuff that y'all been hearin me do, I got it from her

On backwards caus' I wanted to be different.
I keeps'em with a crease tom peeps burn
To nucci, house full of hunnies sportin' gucci, cuttin' coochie.
I'm the man girlfriend, luxury I swim
Macadocious to the most brown sex and slim,
State of uptrends, known for making divedends
And millions my people jump, jump, jump, jump.

To step get deleted by death undefeated
Ain't no thang to put that body to rest
Chest filled with smoke yokin' niggas up
By the collar. Follow me 'cause my dollars
Makin' more cents than common.
Robbin' you for your money and your
Diamonds endangerin' your species,
More like a woman than the bee gees.

Rollin' wit' a clicc supa' thick and everybody gettin' well.

The last nigga figga to ever make it off the hill with steel,
Rhymes rock like Cope the smoke and I'm in effect with
A tech that got a infa-red scope.
Smackin' those actin', tough as Tinactin, fall up in your
Hood increase your brain with the mack 10, stacked N's
Seventeen's on the benz and burn up on my thigh in
Case these niggas won die.

Hear no, speak no, see no, but we know
Good reigns over evil, how it be though

Don't move unless you feelin' the whole move
Like a bomb, gonna blow, I'm killin' the whole room
Still no real souls, heal those through real shows
Broken, how your grill goes, you feel those

That's the reason for me dancin'

Places I've been in, slapping the demons

Steady we on some, lookin' to lump sum
Pull up a gumption, thanks for your function
There ain't no assumption
She said me no son, please bring the lotion
For good body touching with the good body motion
Bitter or habitual
Flinging my bling-bling, this my inkling
To walk with the in-thing
Outernational ghetto, hoo-rah
Big time passion, splash the hoopla
Cigars on push bikes, first-class flights
First-class trains, people look at me strange
They don't know my name but they know my pain
'Cause I'm the stupid in the corner getting steadily canded

As the hip-hop Holy Ghost touchs my spirit
I'm spiritually uplifted, that's what the punches did
And now I'm known and I'm prone to the feeling of havin' a buff pocket but still wanna kill all in my family
Idiot life, you shoulda taught me better
From the very first day, when I very first met ya
I seen the trends, the fads and the phases
The (whole host of points of view? / the old host of 'Points Of View'?) brought to the stages
The sound of 'P' made me feel more conscious
Tuned up my mind to the systems design, but
Those were the days, the era of ""yester""
Now the whole scene's progressed to pimps and OG's
Now I'm the fogey kickin the bogey
With nothing in between and no place for me
Yes I'll take to the trends and split the cliches
I'm a pimpernel man, UVA
Defender of the soul peeing soul decay
Cause everybody...

My origins the projects rebels, steps and murders
My name is the logic connect and vets and burners
If I bang them thanks on this cannon, bet you earned it
Pop up in your zip code aim while I'm loading
Shit and I can let this clip go in the name of this Omen
Leave him holding with my clip grow
Raised on his blowing
Like times in this life of crime, ways never knowing
Contact and touch your body
Trust me I'll be up in that black van no plates rusty shotty
Cause cliques want no drama
With cliques that hold armor
Blitz approach drama from strips to Osama

Hustle and rob
We Infamous Mobb nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous Mobb nigga
IM3's the squad
Infamous mobb and we won't stop till your head goes pop

(Kaos)
It's a potent mixture
Crime fam over infamous beats
Don't get it twisted dunn I spit for the streets
All the baseheads and dope fiends
Little one's that was sold dreams
Gungs with no cribs, dunns with long bids
I spit facts of life, and clap at mics
Turn boosts to crime scenes, who's tougher than my team
No one and Kaos ain't scared of no gun
I look it eye to eye the dot is ready to die
If you ain't back up, cause the mobb will have you wrapped up
Moms crib clapped up dare a nigga to act up
I done hit the streets with bricks, and get back chips
Now I breathe hits on tracks to shut down cliques
It's deeper than sipping on liqs, and puffing on splifs
You might end up sipping on this chrome four-fifth
Niggas sleep in the hood, get clipped in the hood
And Papi come spitting it good
Don't end up rest in wood

(Gambino)
We got four pound chest naked running through the block
When it's on who really gives a fuck about the cops
When a nigga owe you knots he bound to get drop
Moms crying cause her little son got shot
How come?...He owe me a little cake
And the next nigga that pump for me won't do the same thing
We think long range to get those big ass chains
Big ass cars, gripping those movie stars
Who we are... IM3 reppin' to the death
And you'll never catch a nigga like me wearing a vest
Only toting a tech ready to wet the whole set
Ready to wet the whole set
Cutting your neck, beating you in your head till your dead

Hustle and rob

On Them Thangs (Explicit),Mack 10,Rap,"When in the streets I keep my heat on my seat, no doubt about it
It's my Afrikan express I don't leave home without it
Summertime just ain't known for the weather
It's hot cause niggas bring out shit they put together
13 to 14 7's can't miss
But on some shit you got to let 15-8's twist
Chevy trucks and 'em
El Caminos anybody want Danas I got them for eight ??????
All day long
Gold or all chrome it's on
You out to get 'em cause the tires come with 'em
But they ain't for busters only hogs roll D's
So keep yo' stocks on if you can't fade these
Thousand in my pocket, yayo I rock it
Keep my lond clean so the car hops can jock it hit the switch up and down
Make the bumper drag the ground on the 'Shaw
Every Sunday night just to clown on them thangs

Get the hammer
Be sure that yo strap ain't a jammer and as long
As ain't nothin' wrong then beat I'm on
As I watch for the lick I got the switch to make me hit
Front back side to side and three wheel shit
Won't hesitate to let loose niggas broke the gang truce
But I still roll my deuce that hang like a noose
It don't stop for Mack, it's the same ol' same ol'
Danas gold as I lay low, twisting like a tornado
In that surplus gear like the G of the year
Fuck the hour, it's all about the money and the power
Ain't about set trippin' no bloodin' no crippin'
Just dippin' hittin' switches knockin' hood rat bitches
As I'm rollin' out of control and smoking humps
Crank up the bumptie bumps 4 gates and square
Dumps so I bang it, make the 20's slide when I swang it
Lick it once lick it twice as nice
When I hang it on them thangs

D's I'm on 'em
Killas they want 'em
On them thangs...

Old Chevy's to Cadillacs on twisters and Doves
Everybody got a plaque given pub to they car club
Mafia for life individuals and Damus Ride
Majestics and them niggas from the southside
New school to old school get they ride on
Bendin' corners caravaning like 50 strong
In a Rag Top that and a hard top this
Bustin' ho's cause you can't miss if you let 'em twist
So get you a set of them what we call Dana's
And see for yo'self all the bitches they brang us
Cut the wheel right to left and make the ass end slide
Now all the riders ride and skate from side to side
On them thangs"

Wyclef:
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates Those who fake, they break,
When they meet their 400 pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week.
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo
Voo Doo, I can do what you do, easy
Belive me, frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone

Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide
Gonna find you
And take it slowly

You can't run away
From these styles I got
Oh baby, hey baby
'Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go

Oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no

Ready or not, refugees takin' over
The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers

Toss me high - only puff la, With my crew from lock high

Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes)

Night The City Cried,U-God,Rap,"*Police radio* (humming)

(U-God)

Night falling, red dawn, without warning or beef
Late night city life, in the dark Manhattan fog, creep
Wit' cats and dogs become meat
All that is sacred
My body lay naked
Aching for some weeks, maybe it was a hostage taken
Some money making Jamaican
High for thuggery disgrace on did him ugly, kicked his bloody face in
Maybe he was mistaken for some great man
In a dirty place he lay in a gray basement
Shaking his scabs, crack bag, stabbed up four times, strong!
With a long rusty Jason
Dumped the smoldering corpse in a dumpster truck of garbage
In this mad man hell he laid in
Logical was hatred
Some replacement killer came through, left small traces
Engraved his chest
Left him for death
Left him on his last breath
Crawling, just to make a statement (hu hu huh)
In this matrix
Subconsciously gazing the soft shell of a man
Somehow found, amazing!
By the department of sanitation
Under city lights to the hospital
Hit him with the chest rockers, shockers
Pop him open just to keep his heart racing (Clear)

Will he make it?
Will he survive?
Terror in his eyes
Night the city cries
Payback is crime
He damn near died
Banished my wounds not mine
The city cries, drama ride
Guns out the window, slide
Before me now the city cries

(U-God)

Unconscious for months (beep beep)
Deep in coma shock
When you awoke, it was hope
Dry throat
Choking off tools, being fed ice cubes
Pain in you head
Change of the bed
Doped up and soaking while police on top
Doctors monitor your heart (heart beating)
Sergeant Bilko came in with some zombie ass cops
What we have here the chief embraces
In his hands he pulls out two briefcases
A picture popped up on computer
One woman, one man, sharpshooter
He asked you do you remember these two faces?
'Mind you you're blind, completely hung out to dry, victimized
Violated as if you was raped
What the hell
You escape well
Police investigated the scene
Scrape the crime scene
Down to the bone panel
While you lay frail in the enamel
Under you nails in the scuffle
You scratched some DNA samples that match
The blood on your clothes are not yours, it was his
Right before you blacked out, took that blow
In September, you can't remember
You ripped his nose ring
Right out his nose
Before he took it four times in the ribs
But somehow he lived
>From the little bit of blood you grabbed
His skin type, you ran it back to forensic labs
Your finger prints popped up
This is where it begins
Your street name was Henry the Saint
Staten Island's where your crib was at
Park Hill project was your outlet
You was a target
Or organized outfit
Not by the mafia, this where it get chills
Your wife hired some hitman to kill you for your ten million dollar will
Money fund drill
Booby trapped perhaps
Left his food for the rats
Now...

Will you make it?
Will you survive?
Terror in your eyes
Night the city cries
Payback is crime
You damn near died
Bandaged by wounds not mine
The city cries, drama ride
Guns out the window slide
Before me now the city cries

(U-God)

One cop's weakness
Was heroic, he exposed pieces
Leaked out information
On surveillance where his wife was staying
Police tracked her down
Blood hound on the east side of town
In some skyscraper
They had video tapes of her
And some porn star fling, her and the next door neighbor
And the killer with the nose ring
But the police didn't have a case
'Cause the victim couldn't remember a thing
Not even a face
He had to clear his name
He bit off more than he could chew
His absent minded flash backs grew
And grew to hate
He had to escape
To ICU
On the second day he came through
He concocted the impossible
The psych' slipped out the cuffs
Somehow killed to armed guards (bang, bang)
Grabbed their guns
Before he fled the hospital, slivers into the night
If police hunting was right
He's seeking for justice
Off point bulletin
On a black male Jamaican
Meanwhile a dark lookable crook
Is in a alleyway for retaliation
A limo pulled across the street from a gas station
He saw his wife
And the nigga that knifed him
He wanted to mash him
He was real patient
A devilish growl sensation
And the rain grew to a foul meditation (sound of rain)
Of betrayal, murder revenge
Bitch that set you up will get hers in the end
In the hall of the lobby floor
Security on post
Got gun butted three times in the head with the old dusty toast
Now he slipped past the video cameras undetected
To the 25th floor
Apartment 504
When he rang the bell (ding dong) sweet voice said
She cracked it open, her reply I thought you was dead
In a matter of seconds and inches
The door was hanging off the hinges (crash)
Her eyes met the metal
She screamed Oh my God
Out the back room the killer with the nose ring
Smashed the nigga in the head with a porcelain vase
Shots ricochet like lightning roads
Put the bimbo in arms
The drapes caught on fire, with no alarm
They crashed out the window, but they somehow held on
Dangling from a hundred stories high
Don't doubt him
Will he make it?
Continued next album

Will he make it?
Will he survive?
Terror in his eyes
Night the city cries
Payback is crime
He damn near died
Bandaged by wounds not mine
The city cries, drama ride
Guns out the window slide...

Golden Arm is as good as his reputation says
With his bare hands he stood all of us off
And if he had weapons...

Golden Arm never uses weapons
Says he doesn't need them
He says using his bare arms is the best
And he's probably right
Nobody's beaten him yet
Just using his arms he beat us all then
We had no chance
He had us cold"

How could you, even look me in the eye then
You're a bigger person then I ever was
Or at least I'm trying
I should have never touched 'em
We should have never crushed and
Then straight lied to your face about it
No trace of blushing

Shooting all crooked and keep it fucking up a friendship
For some ass, should have never pursued it
Just wanted to thank you for understanding and reaching out
Love Jean, holla back at your homie, peace, I'm out

P.S. just had to get this offa my chest

I hope that all this drama we can leave in the past
Please feel free to write back

Motivated, studious, impervious to outside influences that can ruin it
Anyways listen

It was a long time ago, about five summers
I just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry for cheating
Sorry I wasn't honest, it wasn't a good reason
You probably don't care but I still mean it
Still put it in the air and hope that you feel that I'm being sincere
You didn't deserve a broken heart
And I wish you the world
Love Jean, scream later at your girl

Dear Jean
I see you're doing big things
Congratulations hey I even saw that big ring
Who would of thunk it huh? L-O-L
You even seem content
I notice that you're more focus
Drinking less is well
Anyways it's been too many months having henny days
I think is plenty grave, plus you get your penny saved up
And say what?!? second album
Whatever happened to the thought of edging rapping
Still living in Manhattan?
Side tracking note, just on the low
All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
I've acted horribly, and all my pessemism towards your life
Still bothers me
But you're a big girl now
You've fought and made it through
Best of luck homie
And everything I say is true
XOXO space smiley face dot dot dot comma much love, Hugh

Ah cap locks, delete

And send

[Guy] C'mon we gotta go, what's taking you so long?
[Jean] All right I'm done, I don't bother you when you're writing emails

Never been stopped next to T O P
For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D

Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes

But the only thing you'll get is burn, baby burn

Can't run hack 'cause she gave herself some more,
Give her a dollar, to make her scream and holler
Put my head under the bar and she made me wanna call
Reachin' in my pocket, and pulled out my gun,
Shot her pimp in the head, motherfuckah fell dead,
But now she's in jail in a ten year bed,

Chaos,The Alkaholiks,Rap,"Let it go!
Oh, yeah, we got drums
Woo! Alkahol-iks, let's get it crackin' y'all
Ay J-Ro, teach these niggaz how to stunt!

(J-Ro)
People gather round, J-Ro is on arrival
Raised in the ghetto sing songs called survival
Chillin' in my drawers in hotels like the bible
Alkaholiks, West coast legends is the title

(Tash)
I can't shoot you with my knife, I can't stab you with my gun
So the only thing left is to hit you with the drums
Uh-huh, uh, we in this bitch no kickin back
J-Ro tell these niggaz where the fuck you sippin at

(J-Ro)
Yo, I'm sippin on the dock of the bay, puffin on hay
Used to sell bombay and sip Andre
West West like Kanye, I got the rhythm like Kwame
I used to have a crush on Shante

(Tash)
Yo, E-Swift, I don't think that you bent
But God damn homeboy, where all the gin went?
J-Ro! (Yo I believe that's me)
(Say what?) You up next on the Hennessy

(J-Ro)
And once you hear the Capital J, rap it'll stay
In your brain all day, it always happens that way
I come from L.A., Cali, Eastside of the Valley
Dilly-dally, ran through an alley

(Tash)
Runnin' through an alley in my corduroy flip-flops
We drink a lot of beer so it's that West coast hip-hop
Kickbox our way out of trouble, just to bubble
Meet us at the bar y'all, where everybody love you

(J-Ro)
Yo, my rhymes at parties, took out more MC's than brown Bacardi
I'm totally gnarly
Stumble through the crowd like excuse me, pardon me
Sip hops and barely till I pop an artery

(E-Swift)
My beats so fly niggaz try to charter me
I'm an Alkaholik but that's only one part of me
My main man Tash is like Cool Ra-oul
He got bitches butt-naked in the swimming pool

(Tash)
I'm rowdy, I'm cocky, I'm like Jeremy Shockey
I'm a giant in this game, y'all better back up off me

(E-Swift)
You also the most frosty, drink until we saucy
Keep bitches up all night like black coffee

(J-Ro)
Yeah you know Cinnamon, she hang with crazy Kim and them
They always in the club, tryin' to take a nigga's Benjamins

(E-Swift)
Feminine women, we be runnin' all up in 'em
Then we send 'em home broke 'cause we wouldn't spend a cent on 'em

(Tash)
Aiyyo CaTash a people person, shake hands and kiss babies
Politician in my mission, stack grands and spit crazy

(J-Ro)
I roll with a tight crew like Mushmouth and Russell
Girls wanna grab my love muscle and suckle
Got trees in my duffel, get a ride from the airport
I take the shuttle, no need for rebuttal

(E-Swift)
Huddle round your speaker, got the system blastin
And we takin' everything, it ain't no need for askin
Got the headbangin beats so nigga pass the aspirin
We bumrushin the door in an unorderly fashion
... This is the year that we cash in
Catch me in Miami in the sun just baskin
Catch me in L.A. in the streets just mashin
The name is E-Swift, I move quick when I'm dashin
I'm swift on the cut with my hands when I'm scratchin
Alkaholiks back, and the legacy's lastin

Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and
Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper

The vibe that's been hiding like Bin Laden
Turn the noise down, I beg ya pardon
I get ya, let this shit rumble your garden as the bass hardens
Miss L dot Harman, get the weirdest looks from bar men
They wanna go on silly like the Baha Men

Encouraging my neighbors to be rude
Unable to chew food

Waterloo, what who?
From ABBA to shabba, hip hop, grime to ragga

Interesting, my living room noises are never boring
Grannies wanna kick my door in
We're constantly warring till one in the mornin'
Now lights off, lights on, I'm teasin' them
They think I've gone to sleep but I change the CD again
Now don't go on like you don't like it
You're only moaning 'cause your records are shit
And they skip, now just zip your lip

Just About Over,Goodie MoB,Rap,"Hey, someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

Well I'm lonely and no one understands
The show has fallen into the wrong hands
I am blinded to see all that's passed
To know it was possible, to be as sad as this

I have nothing for to give
I have lost my will to live
I lost my pride, lost my joy and now I've lost my fear
I'd rather die because I am just that unhappy here

Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah (tomorrow is not soon enough)
Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

Man it's 20/20, uhh
It's gettin hard, to Main Street, the Boulevard
Earth warmin, causin the ozone to fall apart
Spark rebellion, I'ma go to, guillotine the Palestines too
Divide the land right, between you

Seas cross, dirt road walked
A lot of folks that don't know, talk
Some that thought they made it got caught
Slay the wicked, spirit'll soon fix it
It's gettin colder I wonder how much older 'fore it's all over

Not long, it was sad, how you killed my son
On the four-zero-five, changin' his flat tire
Suspect's a white male, lead a possible robbery
Hurts my heart that we start off this year like this

Players in position to make differences
but be, charged with rape, with all that debit
while you had it, to take the ?gushy?
Twenties frozen this time
At this North/South planet clinic where abortions are performed

From the start, I see the end
Will we be friends in the end
Took you with me, solo creeps
Never wakin lay next to me sleep

Hate to use you, don't abuse you
I won't lose you, fought to keep you
He dyin to meet you, confrontation
Of the tainted thought, of me lettin you step to

I got caught, messin up again
I just can't win, tryin not to sin
When crackin the gin, makin fat distends
In a time we need to be sober

On my way through Georgia, headed back to Florida
With the Jimmy called Peanuts, mind
in the O, headed to a show
Gone with the strong, up out the do', now..

Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

Lyric Fathom,Blackalicious,Rap,"(Gift Of Gab):
Rappers step to me like I'm a doormat
Check the format, I pour raps
Not your average everyday hardcore act actin'
I'm like a mac 10, a uzi and a AK-47
Rollin' with crazy kids like Bebe
Mayday mayday, I used to listen to KDAY in my heydays
I ride the bus with a dream of one day lampin' inside of a Mercedes
Benz with sheepskin interior
And two fifteens, and to rip means to get creamed
I'm large as a hippopotamus, trip, I gotta dis
Sip a bottomless cup of brew and I'm getting raw to this
If a rapper tries to step, I rip and slaughter his ass
Some shit, he oughta just swallow his pride and get to following this
I'm marvelous like Marvin Haggler in his prime
I carve kids like a dagger with my mind
I start shit with rappers who can't rhyme
I spark spliffs 'cause I don't stagger when I'm high
But when I'm drunk I do, punk I do not acknowledge wackness
I gotcha grandma doin' backflips and tumbles
I rumble through the jungle with Ollie and Frasier
Call me the savior of hip hop
I rip shop and get my proppers
Come get with this ak, my style is akwards
I never mock words, I talk towards the inner city youth
Revealing it, the truth
I'm feeling that the proof is in the pudding
I put men that would end hip hop in my shop and I torture

Check out my lyric fathom
Check it brothers, really, check it out

(Gift Of Gab):
As I walk through the jungle with a knife on my ankle
Taking lives, skip will shank you lyrically
Apparently niggas wanna sleep still
Keep still, I'm packin' the a heap of skills
I'm rhyming to keep an ill mind, Saddam type shit
Your arm might get snapped like a twig
Rap like a nig-gero possessed thorough
The astonishing mission, dishing pain
Fishing in brains, plain lynching niggas bitchin'
So take a ride, I'd abide by my rules
'Cause fools I had duels with, I left them in the pool pit, I rule kids
I'm a kamikaze bomb, drop a nigga with an arsenal of drama in my rhymes
With the tracks and backs and heads is broken to pieces
Rapture's phat, ya dead, ya croaked
I wrote this piece as just a little dedication
To the rappers on the other level
Budded out and looking into space, a new frontier
And I can probably bet cha that we got anything you want here
'Cause punk, we're the crew that make you cheer
The two that make you fear and send you back to the rear
We're here

(Gift Of Gab):
I flip and I rip shit
I whip and I dip shit
With the lyrical form, I did kick it slick
I'm gifted, I'm ripping a nitwit to shreds
Get the Feds to arrest me for slaughtering emcees
That's right, on my testicles
Come get a little array of the skill supreme
Wanna defeat me? My nigga, you should kill the dream
The noise, the boys, the count, everybody
When I drop fat styles that ain't your simple blahzay blah
Lodi Dodi average Joe Simpleton with a average flow
Have to go after you jugular
Then shit gets uglier
Man I hope you take heed
I'm making brain cells bleed in excess amount of hemoglobin
I rap, yes I'm out to see you bobbin' ya noggin'
I've been gobblin' niggas talkin' shit like Hagen-Daas
Stompin' 'em, mobbin' with the ill ass skill as seen
On individuals who fiend for the real shit"
Pedigree,Brother Ali,Rap,"One behind the next in line
It's inspection time let me check your design
Your pedigree don't hold up next to mine
I'm a thouroughbred of the most excellent kind


Brother Ali and who's asking
The text book definition of brute passion
The future, the past, a true champion is born
Never made and that's a label you can't pretend
I think better outside of the box
I rhyme better outside of the booth
There's no hiding the truth, I'm the genuine positive proof

I buck shots through the roof set the hostages loose, shoo
One might got to give real a minute
But it will recognize A alike once the beat finish
Bleak grimacing winters led him to seek vengeance
With every bit the mystique of a street menace
Self appointed judge with power vested
To hand down sentences from bus stop benches
He's relentless with his it's just in his spirit
You don't want to read about it fool you want to feel it

Shit happens but I'm calm in a shit storm
Its just normal, what you think I balled up a fist for?
They probably thought I was born yesterday right
Well mother fucker I stayed up all night
Hit me hard like huh

Oh the flow gon' cold cock you

You a born bitch local showboating impostor
I'm a known credited stone ghetto philosopher
I think very deeply, I aspire to be free
Read through these credentials of mine
I'm exquisite and only get better with time
And not yet in my prime
I age like wine and got a good goddamn head at the end of my spine
Plus I live outside of those confines
Meaning my expression is yet to be defined

Y'all will never try putting ribbons in the sky
You would hit your head on that rooty-poot box you live inside
What you gon' do when the well runs dry
Human beings grown images just get old
So when we get old you gon' be out in the cold
And I'ma still keep chasing what I'm owed

Take a breath to check the Pedigree
Check the Pedigree"
Still Looking,Looptroop,Rap,"I'm feelin' stressed there's a stone in my chest.
I'm miles away from performing my best.
I gotta open up, let go of that weight,
Fast before my past is catchin' up the pace.
I didn't wanna leave, I just had to.
Never knew how you felt about it, forgot to ask you.
I'm glad for the time we had, those years were the finest,
But I can't live in a world full of blindness.
What I'm looking for can't be found here.
The place I wanna go to ain't around here.
So I'm leaving, ain't no packing needed.
If there's a better place to live I gotta see it.
Maybe I am looking for love,
Or maybe I'm just sick of this world.
Don't matter, if I said I cared I would lie.
This ain't the time for bad theories about why.
So don't try to figure it out,
You can't 'cause if I could I wouldn't be where I'm now.
Just live your life and take it easy my friend.
The future is ahead to come and we'll meet again'"
Zealots,Fugees,Rap,"One two, I'm bout to set this up, Like this
Hip hoppers check it
Another MC lose his life tonight Lord
I beg that you prayin' to Jesus Christ
Why?
Oh Lord, Father don't let him bury me, whoa
I own MC's like mephistophales bringin' Swords of Damocles
Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract rap simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by paralax
Check out the retrograde motion killed the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for your bitin' zealots, your raps are cacophonic
If a prick predict but deep inside you wish you had a pop hit
It hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf
To take over the earth...

(Lauryn)
See my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try to take lines and buy grines
We'll show how the refugees do

Behold it's my own manifold on your rhymes
Two MC's can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the law of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics rap rejects
My tape deck ejects projectile
Whether Jew or Gentile I rentile percentile
Many styles more powerful than gamma rays
My grandma pays like Carlos Santana plays
Black Magic Woman
So while you fumin' I'm consumin' mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in Paris
And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a 'muthafucker' so you ignorant niggas hear me
And remember take notes, 'cause I SOE MY RAP OATS
For all you bitin' zealots, here's a quote

Aye another MC lose his life tonight, oh
I beg that you prayin' to Jesus Christ. Why?
Oh Lord, Father don't let him bury we, aye

You can try but you can't divide the tribe
These cats can't rap mister author I feel no vibe
The magazine said THE GIRL shoulda went solo
The guy should stop rappin', vanish LIKE MENUDO
Took it to the heart but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listenin' I knew it was a start
For me to get a chance grab my pen and revamp
Do a Cameo while everyone do the dance (do the dance)
Quit now 'cause you're runnin' out of luck-a
Playin' mister big I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munchin' at your luncheon I'll be plannin'
Your assassination and hit you like The Dutchman

I compress sound sets my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my four five six amtax
Bring terror to the shop of horrors
As she cry 'mi amor!' the Phantom dies in the opera
And to the youngin's who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week and rest on the Sabbath
(Hold up hold up) violence ain't necessary
Unless you provoke me then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you bitin' zealots, your rap stars are relics
No matter who you damage, you still a false prophet"
Dead Dogs Two,cLOUDDEAD,Rap,"""From the height of the highway onramp we saw,
Two dogs, a-dead in a field,
Glowing on the Oakland colliseum green seats wasteland,
Dogs, dogs we thought were dead,
They rose up, rose up when whistled at, 
Their rib cages inflating like 
Men on the beach being photographed,

A guard dog, guard dog, for what? for what?
Against overzealous penniless athletic fanatics,
Getting into games through a hole in the fence,
For the owner of the blue tarp tent,
Pitched by a creek beneath an onramp,

In the privacy, of the last three,
Skin and bony trees, devoid of leaves,
And us undeceased, and with our new CDs,
Zippin' on dead east, Oakland

It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead 
Under a sky so blue,
You have to stop the blood to your head, 
To fit the breath in front of you,

We secretly long to be some part of a car crash, 
Long to see your arms stripped to the tendons,
The nudity of swelling exposed vein,
Webbing the back of your hand,
To be a red tendoned dog, 
To be red tendoned dogs,
Blood breathing by the side of the highway

I long to be dead, 
Center of a curious crowd, 
To be touched, 
Sticky like nearly dried paint, 
Their soft silent stare, nursing your face,
Anticipating the slightest pinch I flinch of pain,
Everyone blank in accident awe,
As the car crash fiberglass dust, 
Straight up settles on your raw muscle tissue

It's hard to stand the sight of two dogs dead 
Under a sky so blue,
You have to stop the blood to your head, 
To fit the breath in front of you,

To be a red tendoned dog, 
To be red tendoned dogs, 
To be red tendoned dogs, 
To be red tendoned dogs,
To be dead center of a curious crowd

Against my misery I don't think I've seen my screeching pain, I can now feel what's around us. It is some sort of harmony, the harmony of overwhelming murder"""
Stop That Train,Vanilla Ice,Rap,"1,2,3,4
It was an average night backstage at a show
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet
Her shape was so petite, and so unique
He eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team
I was one of many that she'd chose
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm
This was far from a story you will find in a book
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain
And all I kept sayin' to myself was

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Oh my God, what have I got into?
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire
The situation I was in could've start'd a campfire
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now
I find me a corner, play it cool for a while
Just Mackin' and schemin' on a woman I tought was cool
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you
You better watch you back 'cause a woman will slay you
Not to mention the one who got me
Yea, she got me, the I-C-E
But, back to the story of a one night stand
I thought I was strong but she was He-man
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush
And all 'n all it was for the lust
I thought, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff
Until I seen her come out with the whip and the handcuffs
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck
And out of all nights, where was me crew?
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do
D already told me that the girlie was strange
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss
Stop this train 'cause I wanna get off

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Later on that night as it got worse
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb
So, now what have I done to get myself into this?
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body
Why did I ever tell her to ""Pump it, Hottie?""
What could I do to just ease the pain?
I think I'll let the hook try to explain

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off"
Reign Of Chaos,Outerspace,Rap,"Second time around plan, sky's the limit
I'm talking bout V12
Talking bout marble floors with cathedral ceilings
We gonna squash that beef for a line of scrimmage
Y'all can get your words in when my lines is finished
I've got a rusty ass blade that will lie on your filet (?)
I did it my way, Sinatra no design the gimmicks
You wanna walk with a flow that I invented
I grind relentless, and climb the cause sickness
I rhyme vicious, in the quest to find riches
We in the world, to get rich or die trying
I mark the globe, and my risk is die flying
And I'da paid my dues and came home broke
So for now when I spit it I'm'a aim at throats
Who don't give a fuck about your man and his lame ass quotes
He wanna come sideways, I only pray they don't

What we have here, is a full blown
Joint for the street to make the QD well known
What we got now is this lockdown
We came to reign and clame our spot now


Nothing you can say could ever take me away
I break atoms/adams like superman, saving the day
Paving the way, sement mace and rap forte
Flood the bars on us with shots of grand mayey
I'm a chemist with the tendency to endlessy spit
I'm a centipede, you envy me the second I flip
I'm the type that post up you say he might be slimy
Since 1990 I've been sheisty and grimy
Congratulations you're the master of hating
Gradually pacing, niggah I'm as graphic as paintings
Candid as Satan, got you niggaz and fainting
This is legendary shit, history in the making
My loud ass can make the clouds clash and concrete crack
New jack got outlast, and do it till I'm on a mountain of cash
With money, machines and my wife counting my stash

Y'all niggaz must be out yo mind,
And you must got it fucked up, like I ain't out for mine,
And you must got it fucked up like we ain't out to shine
About the rhymes, it's like the clock ticks out of time
We gonna send warning shots, ya niggaz doubt I'm lying
I see it for what it's worth, and I doubt I'm blind
We done told ya, before we coincide and combine
You drop dimes, while we dropping heavy line for line
What's mine is mine, no niggah what's mine is yours
What's yours is mine, the same shit its time for war
It's been a drought in this game now it's time to pour
And heavy rain on you pussys running out the door
And ever since blood and ashes we've been out for more
It's why we got niggaz marching while we're out on tour

It's nothing, nothing, bitch ass niggaz"

Catch me clutchin' on my glock when I'm up in the hood

Split you from your lip ta the back of ya neck nigga

All the food sproil - we didn't have a bite in the house
So I did what I had ta do - between me and you
Lil' nigga I pull it off - and no one ever knew

The Nephilium Pharaoh, the three thousand year old scarecrow
Hang you from your nose on a square pole
The squid faced rock beast with swamp croc teeth
And a two headed parrot with a desert fatigue beak
Step out the depths of Hell, exhale sceptic smells
Decorate my bitch breasts with bells
The arthropod tentacles controlled by mental vegetables
Calculated correctitude down to the decimal
Spectacles of doom and gloom and sonic booms
Republicans ride brooms around nuclear mushrooms
You are safe from the nuclear fallout
Now you will crawl out into the hands of a monster now
The best emcee turned his launch codes over to me
On my command you will turn the key and we'll see
You know nothing of discipline, you can never go where the Ripper's been
The maze in those caves are infinite

(Chorus x2: Canibus)
Can't stop, won't stop, Hip Hop Black Ops
The aftermath aftershock is a disaster in a box
With a blue and red ribbon, your writtens were uploaded to the system
The satellite showed me your position

(Canibus)
The text is a sick rep for Rippers
The leaders have discovered we the sickest and they wanna sit with us
Through the computer viewer cube like peritubular
Project: Blueberry Fuscia, one of the two possible futures
Revolution Ripper movement you can't stop it
You can't change the outcome, stop resisting stupid
I write what some would call marathon songs
The music industry tried to banish long bars
Your story is weak, your inventory's shorter than your feet
Every week I slaughter seven beats
I'm the 'Beast from the East'
My title can't be touched nowhere on the street
I hear a lot of emcees speak
They fail to recognise that it ain't about beef
I took it to the streets, I took it to the stage
If I believe I am not the illest I'm insane

(Chorus x2: Canibus)

(Canibus)
The vocal spitter serial killer
Heads up display with a ticker and a pitcher and picture of the Ripper
Neurotransmitters hooked up to his central nervous system
It feeds him the purpose and the vision
Jailbreak but not out of prison
Internal hard drive spinning eighty-eight lyrics per minute
For global transmission, the funky technician on a mission
Strapped to a suicide written
Inside my own mind scripting altruistic composition
Musician, wisdom is God-given
Anoint him with oil, anoint him with wine
Anoint them both with Tesla coils if they quoin my rhymes
I make things real, I make things that ain't, sound ill
A very good screen writing skill
My higher self is outside the realm where time is felt
Inside Orion's Belt, get them"

I'm not a elevator, I'm no come-up
Nor do I go down, do like Brand Nubian, slow down
Whole clip, blow pounds
Silencers steady, that's no sound
Circle ya block ock, merry-go-round
Here we go now, I'm the owner
You're the pitcher, this block is your mound
Buildin' a beast so villians can eat
I reside on the west, chilled on the east
If I say that I rock, then sayin' is gossip

Scored 35 then I wait for a profit

Snitched, triggers and bombs hit the alarm

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why 'cause
Gettin' measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Can I kick it?

This dude approached me slowly and
Told me his name was Jody and
His homies say he know me 'cause he used to flirt with Toni
Say, he wanna get to know me, got some things he wanna show me
Would I be his tender-roni?
Told me call him when I'm lonely
Then I took a couple pictures, feeling tipsy off the liquor
Yeah, my titties might be bigger, but my ass a little thicker
And they like 'em: my weight, my shape, my size
My height, my lips, my hips and my thighs

Acting like a hoe (drop it)

I see my cousin coming, he probably up to something
Look at him, with some chicken head face, know he frontin'
I ain't the one to gossip now, you ain't heard it from me
But that chick that he was mackin' is really a 'he'
And look at her, came out the house looking that crazy
Talkin' bout she got on ""Baby Phat"", that's just fat, baby
You had a cup or two, well that's enough for you
But let him buy you one more drink before you cut him loose
So, gon' flirt a little bit, and make him think you feelin' him
Then smile at him, wink your eyes and make him think he gettin' some
Before he know you by the door, see you already out the door
You won't be home till after 4, won't probably stop at Calico's
Pull up on the parking lot, and by this time it's dark and hot
You circled back around the block, and take the handicap spot
And yeah you might just get a ticket, hell with it, you tryin' to kick it
More than likely if you get the digits, she gon' let you hit it
Drop it

After the club you probably tryin' take somebody home
I guess you betta keep it on the low, don't want your cover blown
So you betta make it known, before they play the last song
Cause you ain't tryin' to spend the night alone, right or wrong?
Got money in your pocket, then take it out and throw it
And put your hands up in the air, if you the shit and know it
This cat up in my face, breath smelling like some shiiit
Teeth lookin' like he been bitin' a bag of bricks
He talkin' bout 'girl'.
You think I told that nigga
If you don't get your funky breath up out my face
It gon' be some shit, don't make me tick
Don't ask me for my name...
And you don't NEED to know my numba...
And don't worry if I got my big ol' booty from my mama
It's the last call for alcohol, and I'm just tryin' to have a ball
Ain't worry 'bout nothing at all, I almost triple play it off
The DJ spinnin' the last records, by this time they half naked
Same place, same time tomorrow they'll be back at it

Drop It... (18x)"

I slang thangs, make bread, easy like Jiffy
Call me a cool nigga or a Mr. refriger'
Kids ask me (""Mr. can you get crunk and jiggy?"")
I reply quickly, bottle of Andres or Crissy
Smoke backyard or sticky, my man, watch me get busy
I wake up with two dimes, both named Nikki
I'm a playa dirty, no passion marks, no hickies
Cats make me sick when I roll through y'all city
Lookin' like angry mad, face mad, teeth gritty
You gon' make me go back into my days of U-City
Cornrows, penny bros and new Dickies
Ah shit, when situation looks shitty
I got that thang with me, plus I Puff like Diddy
You niggas can't hang with me, or pop the pain with me
So wrap somethin' mo' and hop in the Range with me

(Ali)
Check, check
No picture me rollin', Optimo, glocka four-four
Four-do' Range Rov', mink with matchin' Kangol
Whole hood like ""oh"", freakin 'em out they mind
D's with diamonds on 'em, jackers, I know they want 'em
Not, you see the watch, Rollie or G-shot
You hear me four, five blocks before you see me, that's the knock
I need not speak on that, I speak on Zack
And how he better fix my shit or give my eight G's back
Salute the rugged, flip screen, you gotta love it
Navigational system behind the ten, duckin the public
Take my chain off to thaw out, battle four out
We fill, the fattest wad a hun'neds you ever saw out
Son break the jar out, twist the muskie
Only real niggas ride and smoke, patna trust me
If I'm lyin', bad mouth, slap then crush me
Cuss me, suplex lamb, grab the nine and bust me
'Cause only...

(Nelly)
I'm like the battery, I come through every door on a cell (Duracell)
Mr. energizer, forever ready to make a mil'
Fuck that Cris', let it spill, I hit the gas, and make it peel
I'm smokin' twenty inches of Parelli, wha, up off the wheel
I hit the jewelry store at noon, slight case of the chills
I got the face too damn chunky 'cause it's still read ""twelve""
Well hell, not a shit starter but I be startin some shit
Half the time I'm in the club, half the niggas gettin' pissed
Me, got they miss, I done, caught they wrist
And they be thinkin' you cockblockin 'cause you gave her a kiss
I walks over to your bitch and asks her ""who's is this?""
(Yours Nelly)
Tell 'em one more time just in case he forgets
I be the sleepy eyed, kinky guy, the chinky eye
Comin' be like I, ay, EI, ready the guy
Nigga hella high, country grammar, yellin' ""EI!""
Fuckin' your cutie pie, forty-nine, not gettin' none

(Murphy Lee)
You shoulda' seen this ladie's face when I walked in the bank
I'm the school boy, I'm Hollywood, smellin like dank
Lookin' like I don't know left from right
Holdin' a check, got the whole front desk like ""Murphy's set for life!""
I agree wit' em, I exchange sacks with seeds in 'em
Drivin' eighty in the rainiest Rov', TV's in 'em
I'm St. Lou, plus true to the arch equals I'm real
I'm Hollywood, plus true to the heart equals a mil'
I'm killin' y'all, matter fact I'm killin' myself
In a category with T-Boz, I'm feelin' myself
It gets no better, Slo says it gotta get better
Gotta get wood, gotta get dubs, we gotta get leather
I'm like, what, real playas roll on dubs (Lunatics like)
And haters can't kick it wit' us (and our blunts tight)
We smokin' till our brain gon' bust
Gettin' head in the back of the truck, City what up
I'm like only..."
Here Comes The G (Explicit),Mack 10,Rap,"K-Dee talking:
Hey hey hey baby check it out. I'm K-Dee, &
That's my nigga Mack 10 over there. Now he gotta be cooler
Than the nigga thatyou sittin' with, so pump yo' brakes
'Cause here comes the G. Foe Liiife!

<Mack>
Uh that's right uh yeah ha ha ha ha
What the fuck you smilin' at
Right

It's that nigga west side swangin'
Heat I'm bringin' like I'm bangin'
Slangin' khakis hangin'
Took the script & I'm flippin' it
Got bustas straight trippin' it
Never thought Mack 10'll
Be the new nigga rippin' shit
Real G style on a funky freestyle
Solo flo show with my bitch and my lo lo
Gettin' my floss on as I slide my locs on
Hit the corna' bitch hold on
Danas is what I roll on
So watch yo' step quiet it's kept on the leak
I blast I don't stick the different nigga in the click
As I kick rhymes niggas pick mines from the stack
Threw the roof on the sack then cut the 'lac front and back
On all gold hundred spoke D's when I skiis
Nigga please wanna be G's don't wanna see these
Straight from killa Cali it's like the Valley of Death
Of who's left I'll be a G till my very last breath

Alli alli all come free here comes the G <WC>
Fresh as a new pack I'll be doper than my cavi sack
Alli alli all come free here comes the G <WC>
Checkin' loot like it's crazy in painter pants and Stacys
(Repeat)

Now as I roll through the turf with that true G pride
Feeling high as I ride from the west to the eastside
On them switches went from rags to riches
All snitches must die I can't lie
I like them hoochie bitches
Though I know that a hoe is a gamble
Scandle hard to handle them dookey braids and sandals
That's how I like it hike it touchdown then spike it
Then pipe it so tough they can't gripe it
So if it's on from uh dusk till dawn
Keep it crackin' stay packin' as long as niggas jackin'
Mackin' like Goldie bumpin' nothin' but oldies
Reminiscin' tilt the 40's when I vibe the dead homies.

Talking:
Yeah I wanna say what's up to all my deceased homeboys
From the west and eastside didn't make it to see this rap.
Oh yeah it's still Mack 10 foe life puttin' it down like this here.

Down for the dirt I sport khakis and a white t-shirt
Slangin' work got the big birdies that don't chirp
I came up from a crawler now my stack is taller
Big baller shot caller movin' shit like a U-Hauler
So now it's on like that & I'm rollin'
Controllin' the 'hood guns about a boat swollen
Back arms tatted (Inglewood) so tweed can get gatted
Cavi water weed or speed what you need 'cause I have it
So come through run through and uh smell the vapors
Won't be no set trip if it's all about paper
Down with the Lench Mob I can't go wrong
Well known and it's on bankin corners in my Brougham

Mack 10, westside, foe life, and we out"
Before It's All Said & Done,AZ,Rap,"Big boy shit, you dig

Up in the wolves where the deer's run free
Kevlar fire, streets get low key
Ferragamo attire, preach and pope free
Sprinkle in the air, not a wrinkle in my gear
Got my girl wide open, see the twinkle in her stare

Valley stream water, got that valley clean aura
Puffin' Cali green, when I steam I'ma cough-a
Copin' with the game, got me loc'in' at the rain
Lettin' off rifles, vocalin' my name

Postin' in the grain, hear the callin' of the wild
See the birds in the air, hear the bears on the prowl
Chillin' like a villain, got them mirrors on my ceilin'
Pillow top on the bed, takin' shots to the head

Flat screen vision, it's that happy king's livin'
Far from the stars and the bars and the prisons
Being where I'm from, I was told when I was young
Do it big at least once before it's all said and done

Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill
Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel
Do what I want, lay around in my trunks
Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done

Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill
Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel
Do what I want, lay around in my trunks
Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done

It's so much more when you chillin' by the shore
Livin' life to decor, spendin' nights at the fall
Season, no Venetians just drapes and rails
Vacations, no relations just relate the smells in hell

Fresh these breeze, West Indies
Amongst the baddest broads breathin', best believe
Bless the G's, the ones from the cloth within it
Taught through cimmick to con clones off and mimic

Thoughts extended, good livin', sleepin' women seekin'
Deeper enlightenment to keep from dimmin'
Skimmin' through life's chapters, life after I mastered
Seen a spark had the heart to grasp it

Ask it and receive, see you out and believes
'Cause please where I'm from I was told when I was young
Do it big at least once before it's all said and done

Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill
Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel
Do what I want, lay around in my trunks
Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done

Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill
Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel
Do what I want, lay around in my trunks
Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done"

Just lost you, left your shadow in the dark
Fucked around it forced me to hit the shadow with a spark
Blew your shit apart, now it's two halves of one nigga
""Look at him"", I said after a few laughs, ""Dumb nigga""
Stupid is as stupid does cocksucker
And look what being stupid does, get you shot sucker
I let you get too close and you bit me
I suppose it went on for too long you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit me
Well you might as well forget me, 'cause from this point on
It's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone

Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Ben seen the foul shit put the guns in him
Lil wanna be you so why you run wit him
Can't trust niggaz no further than you can throw 'em
You don't wanna murder the niggaz, then you blow 'em
Your using your style, that make 'em yo child
Then he shouldn't make a move till he hear it from yo mouth
We don't allow snakes runnin' wit dogs
Tell them ain't nothing like a funeral it's gonna be yours
Double R, and I ain't here to start trouble god
But if they wasn't your niggaz I would have been hit 'em hard
Niggaz look like they phony, sound like they phony
Run around actin' like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks
But you can still call the apes we bringin' the duct tape

I never did trust you faggot, I'll bust you faggot
What you done forgot about the streets is this
Do a grimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch
Just stop fuckin' wit him, got no more rap
No more, ""Yo what's up, D""? no more that
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off a GP

Hid'in,Guerilla Maab,Rap,"If you a person, and that's hiding
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, be careful how you live
Cause once you lay it down, baby ain't coming back
So when you come through this bitch, hell yeah we coming strapped

(Z-Ro)
Motherfuck I heard a trumpet blow, what happened to the sun my nigga
First on and five coming out the sky, nowhere to run my nigga
Could it be the final call, prepare to be judged
But if it's Armageddon and you weaponless, prepare to be slugged
Ducking and dodging, the soul snatchers
Refusing the mark of the beast, on my head and my wrist
Leaving demons dead in they own piss, until I lay me down
Motherfuckers looking for no one but the harmed, gon stay underground
Up in the Rocky Mountains laughing at us, when we try to run
And ain't no fearing beef on God liers, speak the truth or ton
One foot on the water, one on the land, there's no more time
Ain't no more struggling, no more poverty and no more dying
Nigga get your life right, by living your life right
Cause going against the grain, gains prison in your life right
One hundred and forty-four thousand, are gon make it
Wonder how the rest of us, outside the gate gon make it

(Trae)
Feels like my time is over
I gotta survive, and I ain't trying to face up with Satan
I know I'm wrong for doing him in, but I put a end to they hating
Heavenly father forgive me, these demons are trying to kill me
And all that, I bet that one of us fin to be leaving
I just want to live my life, so I can make it through the pearly gates
Taking steps at a quicker pace, feeling loss and trying to find my way
But at the light pole, everybody's screaming and crying
People selling they soul to the devil, so they can live without dying
I'd rather suffer for doing right, then to suffer for doing wrong
If they come I'ma chop 'em all down to the end, and I'm all alone
To the word of revelation, it reveals what the world'll be
In the ways of the anti-Christ, ain't no coming the G-O-D
So you better believe it's gon happen, sometime he's coming soon
Prepare for the bad life, or else you gonna be doomed
I ain't preaching I'm passing knowledge, so nigga take it or leave it
I'm telling you what I know, and in time you gonna see it

(Dougie D)
Heavenly father please protect us, keep us free from the demons
And all of the parasites and the leaches, and the evil creatures
What you think it's a fairy tale, it ain't no heaven or hell
Don't want to see my imagination, it get read like brale
Ain't trying to teach no lesson, but I can speak on what I know
The end is at hand, and just a man on time to give up the ghost
Did Jehovah have mercy on your kids, in the world of sin
Don't want to get caught up in the whirlwind, of all the wickedness
Leave me knighted to the pressure, but keep me free from evil
Don't want to be a victim of the firery lake, in the jungle screaming
Running and hiding ain't gon save you, try to get away from the flame
Bigger repent, this is your last chance before you leave out the game
Now when you lay it down, ain't no coming back for that final breath
Your final destination, is eternal life or eternal death
Take a look at the crooked, innovator with the life of the righteous
Some niggaz said it's over, some hold on because it's so much crisis
There's so much crisis"

Packing the tame and
Black entertainment
Back with a vengeance
Slapping you midgets
Acting suspicious
The macking is vicious
Vernacular spectacular
Rapping all the time
It's relaxing on the mind
Peace is the word
But I beast on a bird
Trying to feast or splurge
Put them feet to the curb
As soon as you get out my bathroom
And I'm calling a cab too
D ain't that dude
Close your mouth
Hoes is out
In the cold without
No clothes no house
No holding me back
I told you when I get to flow
She a rat
Excuse my language
But they play a game which
Leaves folks open
To any trick she hoping
To get to work
Anything better than to
Hit the turf
Sucking dicks for work
And a straw a skirt
She berserk

You really naughty and you think you awfully foxy
All the stunts that you pull is rather shocking
Go ahead and cock me back in the chamber
You see my weave through the drama and the danger
You do things that your mama is ashamed of
Name one nigga who gonna save you
Ain't one

You really naughty and you think you awfully foxy
All the stunts that you pull is rather shocking
Go ahead and cock me back in the chamber
You see my weave through the drama and the danger

That's just how it is
I don't crowd the wig
With tales about
How you jerks turn out ???
I'm about my peers
My pixels trick hoes
Always try to stir my mix though
Nu-uh not off the herbs and cisco
Brought this shit back
But big though
Now dig, hoe
Keep your lid closed
About my nabisco
Or you gonna get a clip thrown
Into your hip bone
I got the photographs
Of you hoeing ass
Getting fucked slow and fast
Blowing hash

Rebel Yellow,Cecil Otter,Rap,"I'm a loner dotty, they call me Rebel Yellow
But they don't know me dotty.
Hello dotty, you can call me Mellow Yellow.
You know I love you dotty, I'm waking up with you,
But you don't know me dotty, I'm tangled up in blue,
And there ain't nothin' new
I just want to come get my fangs stuck in you

Now I'm a lone wolf unchained with crooked fangs (here I come, here I come)
And I didn't come to put your fire out I don't fear your flames (here I come)
I hear 'em callin your name (for cryin out loud)
I hear 'em callin your name (for cryin out wolf)
I hear 'em callin you out (I hear 'em callin you out)
I'm here I'm callin you out. (I'm hear I'm callin you out)

I raised awareness, so you can call me daddy
I took care of your sheriff, man I'll shoot 'em all gladly
Mr. happy go hungry, on the search for where my badge and gun are buried
Now your just mad or scared
Because you got no more little toys to look after
They said you poisoned a perfectly good pasture
We asked your whereabouts they only had one good answer

And they said there was no choice in the matter
And that their voice didn't matter
And the white noise in your laughter
Was just a void that couldn't capture a filler in time
While you tried to put those pillars in line
I was watchin horror films hoping the killer was fine
Figured it was prime to tinker with your spine
While you played the role of Jesus I was spilling your wine
Just to kill some time, they thought it was for justice

So now it sucks less for me because I crushed your destiny
And ducked the lust for a mess to clean up, you love less of me now
Never trust a breath I breathe out, I'm sufficiently breathless
Just blood and flesh, yes, you see now?
Weed out your garden let me come and find the flowers
Before you summon the final hours for someone that's blind to cowards
I devour jealousy, complaints, and poor sportsmanship

Now you're over-apologetic, wet with a thousand types of tears
And I don't get it, you kept them right behind your ears
Tried to steer me near your beaten path of bad company
I said I keep my feet in glass and that's comforting
That's coming from the king of the road to recovery
Who's got a soul that's old and I'm singin' odes about cold to cut it free
It's just like me, nothings changed

I'm just a lone wolf unchained with crooked fangs (here I come, here I come)
And I didn't come to put your fire out I don't fear your flames (here I come)
I hear 'em callin your name (for cryin out loud)
I hear 'em callin your name (for cryin out wolf)
I hear 'em callin you out (I hear 'em callin you out)
I'm here I'm callin you out. (I'm hear I'm callin you out)

And they said, they just wanted to have a kiss
And you were all like, do you wanna battle bitch?
And then you said, our history is too fragile to juggle with
But now misery's the only man you'll cuddle with
And it's so clear, you drew weapons on those you hold dear
Said you were dancin in private, but you're two steppin on toes here, dear dotty."

We knew of his diabolic plan but didn't know how to stop it, he sent Sentinels but their attack was merely marginal,
Injuries included Banshee and particle Sandman and Shocker, what's stranger than the doctor,
Medusa had to interrupt Blackbolt shut up I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it see it see-through
Deadpool don't play me for the fool Ms. Marvelous, I'd rather starve than kiss her deadly lips
A lady's Deathstrike
It's like open season on me, so I made a crossover call to the Justice League in Washington, D.C.
I work with whatever hand I'm dealt, I felt I needed more vinyl to melt and so it goes with help from super heroes, I felt I needed more vinyl to melt
I work with whatever hand I'm dealt, I felt I needed more vinyl to melt and so it goes with help from super heroes, I felt I needed more vinyl to melt"
All Good (Explicit Album Version),Lil' Kim,Rap,"(Biggie samples: ""It's all good"" ""Gangster"" ""Uh, uh"" - repeat for 21 seconds)

(Lil' Kim)
Every word I utter, I feel strictly gutter
That's why I touch more green than Tiger's putter
So you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna
I ain't worried 'bout none of ya and I'll say it in front of ya
I hear the snakes hiss, talkin' reckless
Thought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street, y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
I guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called ""Wankstas""
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong, I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds
I'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head
Come down with my weave straight sittin' on bread
At the gate, gettin' picked up in a new Coupe {?}

(Chorus One: Lil' Kim)
""It's all good"" - If you drivin' or ridin' the bus
""It's all good"" - In the struggle and the times is tough
""It's all good"" - It don't matter you can ride with us
""It's all good"" - It's all good
""It's all good"" - If you hustlin and huggin the block
""It's all good"" - Workin 9 to 5, punchin the clock
""It's all good"" - It don't matter how you get that guap
""It's all good"" - It's all good

(Lil' Kim)
See I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail
It's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell
The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with lah up in the chocha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy
At age 14 I was puttin' in work
At age 16 I was movin that work
Gettin' paid for drivin' state to state
Smugglin weight, prayin' I don't bump into Jake
I travelled through a few places with the burners
In the suitcases, thank God for Big
Damn right I love the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all

(Chorus Two: Lil' Kim)
""It's all good"" - Niggaz run around stuntin and frontin
""It's all good"" - Talkin' shit but ain't sayin' nuttin
""It's all good"" - It's aight 'cause they time is comin'
""It's all good"" - It's all good
""It's all good"" - They hatin' on me but they copy my style
""It's all good"" - Cracked a smile when they saw me on trial
""It's all good"" - You know you can't keep a good bitch down
""It's all good"" - It's all good

(Lil' Kim)
Cowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down
I come through like two airplanes in midtown
Nigga my get back's the get down
Hit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down
They all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down
Faggots violated I wish they'd try now
Just watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up
Punks gettin' left off right where I pick up
Picture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue
Shoot game official like a ref with a whistle
You know when I do it I'm doin' it monumental

They ask me if I know what true happiness
Do I ever feel regret for all the things I did?
Hell no I love the life I live

Let Us Pray,Killah Priest,Rap,"(Killah Priest)
At night the sky form over my hood like a kufi
I'm carving letters, all of 'em my Uzi
Bitch with the fat booty name Judy
Just left her boutique moonlight shines over her beauty
Bounce off the jury
Every night is like a scene straight out of a movie
It's like everyday somebody's reading the paper
Somebody's reading the eulogy
Far different from the streets elders use to see
But anyways back to the seeming desert
The heaven sent of the plant treasures
Unfamiliar pleasures
Where a fiend plays the part of the peasants
Five-percent lessons play the part of the Shepherd
We the sheep need deep
But if they knew most of us are really predators in our essence
Lower the weapon, AK's and SK's, Saviours' Day
Its saints, thugs on Church walls, now let us pray
-
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray
-
(Killah Priest)
Now move out the way, let the saints pass
Seen the picture on the cylinder
The temple with stained glass
Till the enemy's urn with ash
Light candle under their pic as we burn pads
Learned fast, windows down, when the car turns, blast
Drive-bys, eyes wide shut, we survived
Not African tribes in huts, we died for pride
Bullets will touch, yes, bitch shut the fuck up
Just ride the clutch, king vibe
Prophesize is the demise of Tut
Mummified money for bribes
Country, fly to hide wives, big shit
Head price is vexed, extortion and hits
Coffins are lifted
Bosses and corpses are found in the ditch
Drown, pounds of piff, head and eyes down
I'm just coming up, white nose after they sniff

(Killah Priest)
Gang related, slang debated, nickel-plated
Pistol waving, he a apostille of Satan
Crystal is jaded, a fistful blazing
The secrecy keeps amazing
Secrets of my imaginations
Spinning animation, under the canvas, they're awaiting
My reawakening, still funny my girl's cheating on me
Bubbles in my stomach and one's sneaking on me
She's a freak, she's alone and she's horny
I fall asleep; I see a boner in orgies
And securities, impurities
React furiously, compulsive disorders
Witch torture, big Torah, Rosh Hashanah
Litting menorah's, God aura
I'm flying disc or saucer, over my head
With the crack, Ghetto Jezuz miracles
Turn rocks into bread, shots at the head
Duck it, got up, it's nothing
God gangsta, a rebel, I'm ready
For devils on all levels and pagans
I'm brazing sickles, amen, patient"

Deuce-5 To Life,X-Raided,Rap,"187, gang related, I'm accused
And after every court date my face is on the news
They say I wrote a song about a murder
I maintain my innocence, it's nothing but a coincidence
I'll admit it looks kind of shadey
From the outside looking in
The situation is serious but people don't comprehend
I was 17 years young back in '92
Facing 25 to life for something I didn't do
My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part
And they're using the lyrics against me when my trial gets ready to start
My songs are being misinterpritated
It ain't nothing but the D.A. trying to prove premeditated
They've got X-Raided stuck, majorly crossed up
The D.A. got a fucked up witness and my lawyer is a dump truck
I've been sitting in the county, three years have already went by
They're pressuring my Locs, trying to get them to testify
Snitching ain't no joke, it's hazardous to your health
When you point one finger at me, you're pointing three back at yourself
My homies got convicted for murder in the first degree
Ain't no doubt about it, they'll try to do worse to me
They take me in the court room in front of an all white jury
With the family looking me with barely concealed fury
My lawyer standing next to me, prepared to represent
And help me get convicted cause to him
I'm guilty till proven innocent...

Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life 'cause I'm guilty till proven innocent...

I open up the front page of the Sacramento Bee
And read the article that Dan McGrath wrote about me
He has his own opinion and it's his job to write it
I say he's being biased and completly one sided
The media write their stories for the public to consume
And any chance I have of getting a fair trial in Sac is doomed
Any potential jurors mind is being contaminated
From reading all the bull they wrote about X-Raided
I never told anybody to go out kill somebody's folks
And blaming it all on me and
A song I wrote is a complete joke
They're looking for a move but they're looking in the dark
Putting a noose around my neck and a bullet in my heart
Just because I'm capable of killing doesn't mean I kill
And just because I'm capable of killing doesn't mean I will
I wish they all knew, how can I make you feel me?
X-Raided didn't do it but I've gotta ride 'cause I'm guilty till proven innocent...

Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life 'cause I'm guilty till proven innocent...

I'm knowing I'm going to end up in the pen
Fighting my appeal and hoping that I win
It's me and Baby Bread fighting this fucked up case
Like Dooney and B-Dub trying to get these years erased
In Sac there ain't no love when you're from the Garden Blocc
Maniac, C-Mooney, Baby Snake and Lil' Venom already got washed
I'm trying to keep my head up but my load is getting heavy
It makes me want to do like Sicx: take some Tylenol and get it over with
But instead I just maintain and do everything to keep my composure
Representing the Blocc to the fullest and riding like a soldier
I told you fools the X-Loc ain't going out like the average
I didn't kill your folks but if you run up then I gotta loc up like a savage
On that ass, bitch, it ain't nothing personal thang, it's just about survival
And I'm going to be 125 years old before I die
If I can help it
You made your threats and I felt it but I ain't dead yet
So you niggas talking about
What you're going to do when you see me
I'll be on the weights, wearing state boots and a beanie
I wish I didn't have to be this way but it's reality
So I'm strapped based on the fact
I'm guilty till proven innocent...

Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life
'Cause I'm guilty till proven innocent..."
Phucked,KRS-One,Rap,"Yeah
Y'know when advice is in your face, you need to heed that
Word, you need to read that
Y'know, I put this lil' joint together real quick
You know what it's called?
It's called - NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!
That's right, listen

(Verse One)
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you saw on TV?
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you heard on CD?
You never wanted to work you wanted everything easy
You heard KRS and you said, ""That's preachy!""
A wise young man says, ""Father - teach me""
A foolish young man wants to live life freaky
Oh yes, Knowledge does Reign Supremely
When I said it eighty-nine you didn't believe me

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... that's right
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... life is over, finished, done
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... better heed that, read that
Now you're fucked!

Listen - back in the days on the Boulevard of Linden
BROOKLYN! Kris was a, metaphysician
LOOKIN'! For better ways to live without bein
TOOKEN! We started our own management and
BOOKIN! Makin' moves with them live cats on
FULTON! I can't even 'member all the dough that we
TOOK IN! But you was lookin' down on us
Cause platinum never astounded us, so

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word, like that
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... ha, you shoulda heed that, you better
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... y'all was chasin the radio, remember that?
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... what they givin' you back now?

(Verse Three)
Back when we was all singin' ""Monie in the Middle""
You wanted to wiggle, jiggle in a tight skirt and giggle
Even when outside was brittle, you still had on little
And KRS warned that you'll get played like a fiddle
Now you havin' cravings for pickles cause you pregnant
And don't know where the dad went and you poppin' them drugs like Skittles
When the baby is born it's little and sick
But it's no riddle, you was movin too quick, huh

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word, look at this
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... you shoulda stayed home and read a book
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... literally, symbolically
Now you're fucked!

(Verse Four)
When advice is in your life you need to take it
Cause frankly, everybody ain't gonna make it
Back in the days we, showed 'em the way
I put it there in the music but you weren't amazed
You would criticize, debate, and basically hate
But let it be known I wanted everyone to be great
But you would diss and not even try to do better
When we was at the U.N. you said ""whatever""

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... we movin ahead, you still in the same spot
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... 'member all that back talk, all that?
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... takin' over"

Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush
I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder
And if I left that means I should of booger
Here's a new track, for all the jacks
I'm kickin' it the hardest so gimmie my shoes back
So I live when I step it's the pimp
And I rep so make a right and get left quick
So try to play strong and long gone
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong
Get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

Only if you want it
Yes I really want it

Only if you want it
Yes I really want it

Only if you want it
Yes I really want it

Only if you want it
Yes I really want it

Ooh a new jack! a new jack

(Eazy-E)
Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back back smack, here comes a witty black
Endin' in a skull high I'm bout to show why
Eazy's fillin' caps cause my gat's in the low ride
Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat
My homie rides shotgun waitin' to spot one
Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride
I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey
So don't butter, Eazy-E but a park hey
The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather
I see the smilin' faces of while they sick
Ya know me better, hard Rodney kid
Gettin' Cali kid, now ya know it boy
Left up in the alley dead
Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

Only if you want it

Only if you want it

Lose In The End,Casual,Rap,"How'd I get here,
Dwell through the hauls of all this confusion
Usin' my tactics to stay alive,
Wait astride when they try to get ya,
Pretend they the bomb and they gonna get with ya.
Run get away wouldn't care to stay and try,
A peace ralley's not a place to die.
Flee the park peoples pigs is comin'
Your already homeless
But they want ya gone in less then three,
Eat away the P-O-L-I-C-E, and I see the billy club.
He'd really love to hit me or get me
But my 3-5-7 is wit me.
Ain't goin' out I ain't,
I'd rather paint chalk around a pig then a brother who's dark.
I never ever walk streets lonely,
I always gotta have my millimeter on me.
To kill or beat a bald Bill or Ted officer,
Lootin' so you shootin' and ya go off with tha trigger,
So ya figure
You need to dig her.
Nigga of some brown but it ain't happenin'.

Didn't wanna cap him 'cause I knew it wasn't wise,
Realized that my plan b was comin'.
I need a concoction to block men and auction off them
Just like they did us in dock ten,
So now I stalkin' walkin' with myself,
And plus Tajai's swiss knife from off the shelf.
To shake the likes of black abusers.
And use a can opener, to open ya,
Skin and then dig in and twist and turn,
And salt,
Burn!
Left him cryin' that I'll never get away.
I always get away,
I always get away.
Retreat and bag off,
Call A-plus he must know that I'm about to fag off.
Tell him he sager,
Inhale when I heard the word was abandonin' me,
My plan would be crumbled.
I tumble down in tears,
Pressured by the cops and neglected by my peers.
But now I gotta go on all I know,
Phuck it I'm a call a ho.

The spot I'm hidin' in is not tight,
B-P-D see me
Spotlight.
I gotta get movin'
Hopin' fences, droppin' senseless men
Who try to stop me on my way.
They in pursuit of a cute kinda demanded,
Man and then away the fly guys landin',
And then they gon get Buck-ba-bo-bo.
Buckshots and a lugged gun used up,
Who's up next?
No one.
I go run the whole one,
Hopped in, stopped when.
I noticed that the quote is from good times...
I'm the man.
There goes the brothers who bit ooh goody,
They got 'em surrounded description blue hoody.
That's what happens when ya wanna wear your apparel like mine.

Couldn't Figure it out??
Ya Lose In the end!"
Player's Ball (Reprise),OutKast,Rap,"Here's a little somethin' for the players out there hustlin
Gettin' down for theirs

And if your hoe is actin' crazy --

I hope when all y'all dance is over, can I get onn, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, whoa, about

All the players came, from far and wide
Wearin afros and braids, kickin them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player ball is happenin', all day eryday"
Things Are Looking Up,Classified,Rap,"(Intro: Classified - talking)
Yo C, give me a little bass
(Things are looking up, things are looking up...)
Put in some bass, give me the keys
Just give me some feel good music
I need something to cheer me up
Something to put a smile on my face

(Verse 1: Classified)
Look, I'm hangin' by the end of my rope
Feelin' defensive and broke, with no intention to cope
When the weather is cold and the adrenaline flows
And everything is lookin' down (hey!), there's no mention of hope (ho!)
It's hard to get away, so we tend to be prone
And the world seems depressed, so when you're in Rome, I guess
I gotta keep the engine afloat
And when the water leaks in, don't abandon the boat
And yes, soon the depression will fold
It's a battle and ya gotta choose your weapon to hold (ha)
I figured that we've learned from the lessons of old
It ain't over till we meet up at the end of the road
Yeah we destined to grow, so remember control
A bit of patience can work as a friend or a foe
I'm lettin it out, so I don't bottle it in
I'm puttin' up, things are looking down, no not again

(Verse 2: Chad Hatcher)
I've seen the sun come up today
It will probably change to rain or something
It's hard to keep a smile on my face sometimes
I know that we can find a way
To forget those little things that stop us
And push on through the rain and the sun will shine
'Cause hope will only get you so far
Have a plan and know where your friends are
If you leave your town just to find your place
And run from things you find you can't escape
You can find what it is you see
Take it day by day, take it week by week
Just push on 'cause when things get rough
No head down, things are looking up (things are looking up...)

(Chorus: Chad Hatcher - w/ ad libs)
I gotta hold on for one more day
I gotta hold on for one more day
I gotta hold on for one more day
And I gotta push on 'cause when things get tough
No head down, things are looking up

(Verse 3: Classified)
Yeah, we do that feel good music
So feel good to it, it's the fuel to get through it
Problems Houston but we are only human
So air out and deal with the heat when it's humid (yeah)
I'm lost on a path that is mapped out (ha)
On the mat, thinkin' maybe I should tap out (yeah)
But in time the anxiety will pass slow
I use to worry but now it makes me laugh though (huh)
Fuck it I'll be blunt
I'm sure we all thought about suicide once
I know I did but I never made the cut
I guess I never had the guts or wasn't selfish enough
We push on every day that's just how life is
Until things are looking up like gas prices
It's ironic, the irony is clever
But once you hit the bottom it can only get better

(Verse 4: Chad Hatcher)
I know that there will be a day
Or two that come as a surprise
But things will seem way to, good to be true
I just know there's another way
To clear a path through all that stops you
With nothin' in the way, there's nothin' to lose
I don't know what it is these days
I seem to spend them in a daze
I got plans that are hard to keep
And lately man, well I don't get no sleep
I can find everything I need
Take it day by day, take it week by week
Have a drink, maybe have a puff
And don't look down, things are looking up

(Chorus: w/ ad libs until the end)"

Will You Ever Know?,KJ-52,Rap,"What if what if what if what if what if what if you was transported in time
To the place and the spot where Christ had to die
What if you beheld with your own two eyes
Where his blood was spilled where he gave his life
When he came up the hill and he was barely alive
Could you tell who he was if he walked on by
Could you see what they had done to his back and his sides
Would you see all his love would you recognize
When they pierced his skull with the thorns and they tried to
Pull out his hair out his beard and then decide to
Pierce his bareback 39 times you
Get the real facts they're there besides you
What if you saw him die and got a real view
Would you keep living the life the way that you do
Or would you run and hide and just continue to
Live your life blind it's up to you dude

Will you ever know will you ever see
What's he's done for you what he's done for me
Can you ever know can you ever see
What will it take for you to believe

What if today was the very day he died
What if you was standing right there by his side
As the people cheered and they screamed and they cried
But this time around see he wasn't crucified
What if he was led from a jail cell this time
To be executed in the middle of the night


But you could view it and tune it in worldwide
On the internet and on the TV it was televised
What if you was standing right there
And you brought him down to the electric chair
You had to flip the switch now would you be aware
Would you understand his death would you even care
Would you change how you live would you shed a tear
Would you see what he did would you be prepared
To give your life to him right now and right there
Can you see what he did it's quite clear

What if you held the very nails used to
Hold him on the cross then what would you do
You saw him beat up beat down then abused
Would you see how much it cost him now for you but
What would it take for him to prove
That he took the blame for everything that we do
It's still just the same man there ain't nothing new
They still hate to change and come down to you but
What if you could gaze and just see
The last 5 minutes before he would leave
This earth and worse what if you saw him breathe
His last breath when death took his life you see
His head hang down he starts to heave
'Cause his death came slow it's plain to see
That it's more painful then we could imagine it to be
Now you seen in plain view will you believe"
A-Plus,Hieroglyphics,Rap,"(A-Plus)
Yes, yes, yes; yes

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Whoa!

Hoo Hoo!

Shit, shit

Only so much is critical
In my relation to the individual
I remain hieroglyphical, ripping it for
Fans appreciating, flows, not depreciating
I'll try not to keep you wanting, but I can peep you hating
The situation so degrading, and pitiful
So many butt ass tapes out man, so much shit to do
I been to you MC's, stead you think you got the room
I sock it to 'em
Like a flamer getting his ass beat in the locker room for peeking
You'll never forget the day I sent you there
To intensive care
On the respiratory, get some air
Breathe deeply
Listen to advice, you need beats see
Plus skills you missing on the mic
It's like something about my rational and analytical lobes
To make me gifted with flows
That'll get ripped fa' sho
On the mic I never act like I was born hard
Telling lies for cash or selling my ass like a porn star
In Cali, the jealous rally in hundreds
We went from signed to independent
And they offended 'cause they ain't done shit (Busters)
But we in though, popular like indo, in the ""O""
Where they throw your weak ass tape straight out the window

'Cause it's weak as fuck
I want my money back
Wack ass shit
Shit hella butt
Hella butt"
No More ?'s,Eazy-E,Rap,"(Female: We're sitting here with Eazy E)
Believe that
(Female: How are you doing ?)
All right
(Female: So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?)

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin, I specialized in gankin
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin' fun
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin', and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?
Hell no! Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
At anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?

Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Aasily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shhh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
Out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a 211?
Yeah

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick?
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it""
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true?
I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy

Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N.W.A. and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
Female: What's your real name?
No more questions"
West Savannah,OutKast,Rap,"Yeah, back off in this bitch one more time
About where my roots at
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale in the house
So check it

February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mama had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities

Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin' over foodstamps and hittin a lick was next see

I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi

So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin' reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me

They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the beans, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me

But go 'head on with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmhmm
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmhmm
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

See, niggaz in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doin it for years, so these niggaz ain't gone change
They comin around the ghetto so you might call 'em soul
Been wearin furry Kangol's, so that shit is old

You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump

I'm down to stick a hoe if she got a G-strang
'Cause the niggaz in the Pointe ain't changed, man
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmhmm

Turn it up! Go to the bar, pop a bottle and

'Cause they hang all over Tash while I smash my Range Rover
They know me and Ro and E-Sweezy pop
'Cause we been around the block like ZZ Top
It's all fast cars and chicks while I walk with a big stick
By God he's usin' guns like the West coast Slick Rick
Pick your poison while me and my boys destroy 'em
With the Alkaholik sound that make 'em look for new employment
The answer to the West coast question is us
Everybody in the house come drink with uhhhhhhhhhs

It ain't nuttin like Likwit music
Chop a beat up and then reuse it
Pop a bottle we can't refuse it
We pour 'em, let you choose it
Everybody in the house turn your glass up
Party all night, we gonna party till the last cup
All the ladies in the house, get your ass up
(Hurry up, run!) To the floor before the last cut

My nigga Kyjuan gon' kick this shit out right here,
We the Lunatics, no doubt
We gon'..., they wildin, they don't know

(Kyjuan)
Ay yo
St. Louis is small but we still do it all
We hit the mall, we drink it all, we always gon' smoke it all
Get hit, we shake it off, at the club yellin' ""take it off""
My success is takin' off, I'm always workin, never takin' off
I done that, did that, who her? I don't hit that
Cats be trippin' off them rats, I ain't really with that
Makes me wanna sit back, I relax and think back
To when I used to click-clack, makes me angry when I flash back
Mo, you should get back, I mean this, hang with the meanest
Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest
You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns
St. Louis where we from, you ain't never heard a weak one

(Ali)
You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever
Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever
Fucked with the real crazy, pyscho sick ??? lady
Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty
By my sack, cock and load it, this world I'm a rock and roll it
My business, you shouldn't a told it, to end I'm a forty-four
They switch guns and they go for show it, your pupils is dialating
This rap is so beautiful watch The Source give it higher ratings
The 'tics j-just can't be faded, to nothin' that's star related
More than just duplicated, Kenjuana's to celebrated
Got damnit we finally made it, haters they gotta hate it
Bought my house off and finally paid it, often intoxicated
Just call me the Don-dotta, original rider, rider
Your mama just gotta, gotta, take her home and here ""splatter, splatter""
Splatter, splatter, I'm from St. Louuuuuuuiiiiiie

(Chorus - St. Lunatics) 2x)
S-T-L is where we stay, in the middle, no coast
Lyrics boastin with flight, what up hoe, I'm just your neighbor, what up
St. Louis' finest, keep a cover like Linus
Stop your ass up like sinus, congest ya till you learn your lesson, we blessin

(Murphy Lee)
Now you can find Murphy in a Jag, on a commercial
When at home in St. Louis, yo I's a *walkin* like Herschell
I be like (oh, oh, oh)
Wit' a pocket full of bus tickets, lookin' at booties thinkin' I must hit it
(EI!)
Why must I live like that, what you expect?
Young dude done paid bills with them advancement checks
Honeys screamin they want more than sex, I'm like ""why me?""
??? Take that Lex to like me
I be the young dude, Mr. drop a top a bubble Benny whipper
(What else nigga?)
A weed head slash Henny sipper
No I'm not ballin
I'm tryna' get it how I live and how I live is how I get that shit
I'm like nine-nine-nine-na-nine-nine-na-nine short of a mil ticket!
(Chachi'll take it) and say that Bill did it
But I'm a be real for real and deal wit' it
And get mine in the summertime like Will did

(Nelly)
What you thought I was gonna do, bitch and scream, fuck my dreams?
Walk off the team like Rodman?
Move the scene, nigga what you mean, not now playa I'm swabbin
I put four silver dollars up on a white castle out in ??
Get them things out and cock 'em, anything bubble I'm poppin'
Anything stumble, I'm droppin', whatever you rollin', I'm toppin
And it's fully loaded, I'm coppin, wheww
No more slang rocks, I rock rocks, you duck cops, I cop drops
You buy cock, I buy stock, touch mine, you are not
I'm Rocafella with *hard knocks*, dome shots till I get popped
Used to ball on the blacktop now I balls on hardwood
With enough finance stability to finance a small hood
Call it Nellyville nigga, and guess who the mayor
My whole towns chronic'd out so we ?? ??
I'm playin' truth or dare with dime pieces, and they nieces
Showin me there's more than one way that they can eat a Reeses
Can I repeat this, man, you niggas need to see this"

Mack 10-
Homey, Same thing make you laugh make you cry,
In the fast lane the strong survive and the weak die,
That's the way the ball bounce and I often wonder why,
But I needs it all and not just a piece of the pie,
I used to hope and wish for everything I couldn't buy,
Was a young ghetto boy that grew up in the ""I"",
So I vowed to be a hustler and reach for the sky,
And not only am I ballin'right now its mo' tie.

Ice Cube-
It's like a jungle sometime you gotta hustle,
Sometime you gotta use your mind, mouth and ya muscle,
Sometime ya gotta grind stop lookin' fo' a saviour,
Use what the fuck god gave ya, flava,

Trying to get out the gutter fo my life sputter out,

Dub C-
I was raised a young nigga wif squabble,
In the city of locs, no hope and rolemodels
The black sheep of the family, destined to fail
Predicted to spend my hole life in a jail cell,
Fucked up and not believing the hype,
I knew id be more then a felon
And soon dub'll see the light,
Nigga got my mind right, nigga got my grind tight,
Now a niggas getting paid to skip skip through the lime light

Mack 10-
See we all got problms but sum need addressin',
So at night I hit my knees and thank him fo my blessins',
And ask him fo forgiveness to minimize my stresn'
And continue with the know how to dodge these smith 'n' wessons
And with his help I will perform at my best,
And its still hard with all this temptation and testin,
And if I'm wrong I just accept as a lesson,
As I conquer all my enemies and mash 'em with aggression,
Lord

What don't hurt chu, will only make you stronger,
In this game you gotta have heart,
This hustle will break you down pull you apart

Cause most of my lady's friends are chickenheads

You can lay across the couch and put your head on my lap

-Knock on door-

You fuckin' her? What you tryna ruin my world!?

(Apathy)
Yo first of all kid! Take that fuckin' tone out your voice
We boys but what you girl does is really her choice
Now she's sittin' lonely at home while your doin' your shows
Besides son, I thought it was bros before hoes

(Louis Logic)
So if your clothes come off while your chillin' with my sweet thing
I'm supposed to let her share her g-string!?
Imma take that anniversary ring right back to Zales
Ask the sales girl to take back the pearls!
Smack the curls off my ladies head and kill you for your treachery
You said you were my best friend, instead you got the best of me

(Apathy)
Yo Lou, this shit is hectic B, I'm really not the enemy
It takes two to tango and we share the same energy
One night over some Hennessey we started messin sexually
And well, now we dealin' with an unexpected pregnancy"
Beware,Mystikal,Rap,"Chorus: Mystikal Making Noise

First Verse:

Beware!
The man with the braids done walked in
Mild mannered like Clark Kent
I'M rougher and tougher than dead shark skin
This man gonna be have you flippin' like the pages of (???)
Evil like Cruella
Five minutes later I'ma still be hard as an armadillo
Roll like an eighteen wheeler
Shinin' like the slipper
Of Cinderella
And bad weather
And acapella
This fella
Top seller!
Gonna be that way till I'm old as Mandela
Still gettin' better!
Writin' rhymes I'm best of 'em
I'm the arrester, I'm the professor
I'm the nigga that keep his picture on your girlfriend's dresser

Tell me what you muthafuckas know about gettin' ROWDY
Tell your whole Sunday gang 'bout it
Bitch I been 'bout it!
Now, I kick the rest of you into HASH
Bow grasshopper, bow to the man!

Second Verse:

Ah!
Bet'cha runnin'
I bet'cha, bet'cha I'm best that I'm better
Run with a letter
Swift as a jet or keep up with the pace setter
Sparkle like glitter
Hard hitter
Hoe go-getter
Side steppin' from no nigga!
Whenever you bitches decide you gonna get too big for your britches
Leavin' you stitches
Diggin' ditches
Sufferin' hickeys, cuts, scrapes, bruises, welts
Don't fuck with the RHYMIN' BLACK BELT
Watch yourself!
Boom! here I go!
Boom boom! I know!
Y'all niggas can't fuck with the man with two tongues, 'cause that's the way I flow
'Cause I can get hot like fire
And you can't put it out, it's like tip-toein' on top of barbed wire
For instance, persistence
No resistance, stay your distance
Is vital to your existence
You leave it to me to show you the way out
I'm never gonna play ya
I'll take your old lady
Even if I took my braiiiiiiiiiiddddddds out!

Third Verse:

And I'm uh, ready, and it looks like ALL you bitches are rusty
Y'all can't buss me, don't cuss me
Hit'cha, so much muthafuckin' we gone leave this bitch musty
You disgust me
Trust me
When Mystikal hits the door, you bitches be SCREAMIN' to touch me
I'm the invisible man you can't see me
I'm mackin' illusions and confusion
I'm abusin', your conclusion, and contusions, from the bruises
Issuin' these muthafuckas with the style that them bitches want
FIVE FOOT ELEVEN, screamin' to heaven
I say FUCK SHIT GOD DAMN
Bitch respect me like a reverend, and...
Congregation say ""Amen""
(Amen)
Come through this muthafucka swingin' like a CAAAAVEEMAAAN
And you against me, you better not say it go back in the water

Since you wanna BOW muthafucka
BOW to the master!"
Children's Story,Slick Rick,Rap,"""Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story please, huh please?""
""Yeah, please?""
""Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the story book""
""Yeah, alright""
""Y'all tucked in?""
""Yeah""
""Here we go""

Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
Where laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to, good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
""Me and you, tonight, we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""

They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another ""stick 'em up, stick 'em up"" 
And a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin' erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""

Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why'd ya hit me?""
The barrel set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigga""

So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radio's in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
He decided he'd head for the subway stations

But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him, ""sorry""
Then he made his move to an abandoned buildin'
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up a door there, guess who he saw?
""Who?""

Dave the dope fiend, shootin' dope
Who don't know the meanin' of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun

He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doin' 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive, though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran outta bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head, he said the gun was fulla lead
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""

Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
""Uh huh""
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story

He was only, what? 
""Seventeen""
In a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
""Uh huh""
Just another case about the wrong path
""Uh huh""
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good Night

Talk about the box, Rick
Talk about, Rick...

""Oh boy, that uncle Ricky, he's really weird""
""I know right, what does he mean, straight and narrow or your soul gets cast?""
""I don't know you'd think he'd be crackin' up too""
""Uh huh, I don't know,'night""
""Goodnight""

Talk about the box, Rick
Talk about, Rick
Talk about the box, Rick
Talk about, Rick...

Boom shaka laka yo here comes the Chief Rocka
Rock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca
For sharper type to battle make the people say ooh ah
Think I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta
?Hey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because, I'm that type of guy
Now fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?
Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes?) It's gotta be the shoes!
Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
So I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like jump and a grump and sound over some uh!?
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!"" C'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funk
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand, I'm the motherfuckin man
I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around, let them know who wears the crown
Who's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun?
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funke, uh

(Verse Two: DoItAll)
Well umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the flavors, the funk
Whew! And it's smellin up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka, so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe
I snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough, see if
I was an Indian I'd still be the Chief
The only other difference I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby to the hibbidy
Hip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop!
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&B ya see, all that's cool, but
Hip-hop and rap yeah that's where my heart's at
Even back when I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'
Before I had a record, I always kept 'em clappin
Freestylin on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit, make you jump like House of Pain
Boogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump
And remember, remember, Chief Rocka won't front

(Lord Jazz cuts 'The Lord Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka' x4)

(Verse Three: DoItAll, Mr. Funke)
[DIA] Ay Mr. Funke
[MrF] Whassup?
[DIA] Can I get assistance?
[MrF] For what?
[DIA] For what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut
Well back is the backer, I'm chillin' with my knocker
And if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like
[Duo] what goes up, must come down
[DIA] But not me clown
I cut em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin
So jump in, and watch your earrrs start hummin
Through the block, and don't forget to boom shak shak-a-lak
[MrF] Well damn DoItAll can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So now what do they say, when I'm walkin' up the block?
Boom shaka laka there goes the Chief Rocka

Stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The halflife the Illadel-L-P-O-phila proceed
Hither is my death flower blow your tower to smithe-

Deeper than the meditations of a hidden worshiper
Unorthodox, hip-hop, minister
Then a Serengeti cheetah my thoughts with the
You lose your balance when the sound hits ya
So check for the, fifth militia

Even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya because you amateur
Styles gunning down your sound man and manager
What?? This how we do it in the year for nine-six
With this delivering attack on pointless rap shit
Breakin MC's down to fractions, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war we spar reaction

Verse Two:

The implorer, the universe explorer
Treat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Leavin' these niggaz open like a box of Pandora
With styles that's newer than the world order
Approximately three quarters of y'all are water
I straight deport ya
Then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
The pill brimmage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist, and the strong get a percentage
It's ill as a war and within it I'm the Lieutenant
That surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
I crush a mountain into grands of sand
Your pain stains the cannon of the mic inserted into the stand
The desperado, that refuse to follow
The lip afficianado, break you up into parts like a bottle
I deep like the dark of the night
Niggaz is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back and forth the same
Old rhythm that's plain
I'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain
It's the hip-hop purist, that leave you lost like a tourist
Inside the chorus, niggaz is bringin' nothin' for us
As we breakin 'em down to fractions, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war we spar reaction"
Killers,Ice T,Rap,"A man took an ad on TV
To enrol in the police academy
He's very talented, outstanding proof
From his clean-cut appearance to the shine on his boots
When it comes to graduation, he's number one
An expert with a rifal and also a gun
Three weeks on the beat and his weak nerves crack
And fires four warning shots into a kid's back

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers

A young girl marries an older man
With more money than you can understand
He smouthers her with pearls and jewellery
And they both seemed as happy as they could be
But three months later, she's sad but content
Seems he had an unexpected accident
The girl said he would be hard to forget
As the papers interviewed her while she flew his jet

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! she was the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers

Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

An young man loses his only job
To proud to hustle, too honest to rob
He goes to tell his family an his wife
But an argument breaks out, she grabs a knife
Tempers esculate to a total rage
Shots burst out from a loaded twelve-gauge
They call it mass murder, suicide
But somebody tell me why the kids had to die

Can't get a job in a candy store
Unemployment hurts and he's living proof

He shows no pity as victims are shot
The only thing to stop him are the bullets from SWAT
Ten people died on a sunny day
But tell me who taught him how to shoot that way

KILLERS! these are the killers

He tries to fight execution with petitions and pleas

High voltage fills his body in a ... jail
And all of the people of vengeance grail

Couldn't get a girl, let me tell you all why
He tried to be down like all the rest
Had girls in his hair, gold on his chest
He rolled around town in a coup deville
But he had no money, he was broke as hell
Ladies love money and he needed more
So he tried to steal something out a liquor store
But before Georgie-Porgie could get away
The man pulled out his gun and blew him away

F*** it in my pockets I barely gotta twenty
Dollar bill but I go to shows
And make you holla still
I gotta pay my bills and it's not like Prada will
I go to the check cashing spot
Will I always be a have not
Never gonna live in no lavish spot
Always gonna live at home with mom and pop
Shop at Old Navy and Payless
I'm just tryna be honest that why I say this
Hopefully radio plays this I doubt it though
Yo pass that Olde English

Yeah I be rockin' the discotech
Every single night no self respect
Sometimes I feel like I party way too much
Premieres openings and shows and such but
What else is a girl to do
Go home by myself at 2
In the AM I'm sayin' I'm not playin'
I'm doin' the same stupid shit and it's day in day out
I know that there's gotta be a way out
But I keep drinking and I just stay out
At the hot spots with superstars and the hardrocks
I wish that I could disappear to the boondocks
Why not, maybe I'll hire me a pilot
To take me away to the shade and I'll stay
Get a slice at Ray's like we did when we was kids
Something's gotta give real soon but it's not this

On the real I be hatin' myself sometimes
I know you do too but it's okay sometimes
I'm tryin' to escape the grind sometimes
It ain't gonna get better if I do some lines so
Enough with the parties and bullshit
I go to the parties and bullshit
It never gets better when I do this shit
So stressed I wanna get up and quit
It's like maybe tonight's the night and
Maybe if I socialize I'll feel all right but those
Never seem to be the best laid plans
Never did I dream I'd go to foreign lands I just
Wanna lay in creamy sands
Doing nothin' all day with my dreamy man maybe
Buy that house across from the projects
So I can stay trading gossip like stock tips

It's not at the after party
It's not in the hotel lobby
It's not in magazines
And It's not even in my dreams
The things that I need
Ain't in the vip
Don't know what it is
It's definitely not this"
The Birth Of Foxy Brown,Foxy Brown,Rap,"Oh shit! Oh my God! This shit hurts! What is it! What is it! Oh fuck is girl! Is a girl! Oh let me hold my baby...
You know...
They don't fuck messed up know, I mean, I finally got my Chyna Doll...
What? A little Foxy! You know Foxy...
Mama as ben puttin' down in the streets for many many many years...
I'd run with the baddest niggas out here...
I mean, I own the hookers, I mean, I own the pimps, I mean, the street was mine...
But I got you Chyna Doll...
Now the street is yours...
I want you to get out there and make your mama proud...
But remember...
Only one person can judge...
So baby...
Live your life and go out there and be like a gangster"
I Won't Ever Stop (Ft. Goldinchild),KJ-52,Rap,"I heard 'em say me and K don't even speak no more
Then why you hear my voice coming out these speakers for
We gone keep on talking we gone keep on walking
Past these cats and this trash that they keep on squawking
Went our separate ways did our separate things
But real friendship is something you can't separate
I had to deal with pride I had to let it die
I thank God that we set our differences aside
It's S.O.I. there ain't nothing you can do about it
Log onto chat rooms go ahead and tell your crew about it
Say what you say but me and K know the truth about it
God forgives and your lying we can do without it
So while you spread gossip we gone spread gospel
Speak that truth and keep it moving like some real apostles
Call us Paul and Silas man you can't divide us
Praise God cause the Spirit is the light that guides us

I will never stop
Will never quit
Will never drop till it's over with
I will never stop
Will never quit
Will never drop until he said it's finished

The first thing I heard I was wack and I was white
The second thing I heard I couldn't rap and couldn't write
This occurred and happened pretty much all my life
So by the third time I just laughed at 'em and rocked the mic
It just happened to make me work harder and work better

My mailbox was filled up all the rejection letters
One day I'm a take 'em all out and put 'em together
Frame 'em stick them on my wall now so I'll remember
Where God brought me where God took me
Where God got me from where I just should be
You can't stop me from being what I just could be
So what you say and what you state ain't never shook me
I ain't no veteran but I sure ain't no rookie
Anywhere that I've been is cause God took me
And I'm gonna go with him anyplace God put me
They couldn't comprehend they never understood me but...

I needed one shot I needed one break
Instead I got them telling me that I ain't got what it takes
But listen and think about the next time you wanna hate
See God's got a way of using the least likely candidates
I seen the closest of my friends up and leave my life
The ones I would depend on didn't treat me right
I'm trying to hang on it lead to some sleepless nights
But I stood strong only cause of Jesus Christ
I been down and out I've been tossed away
I been lied about been booed off the stage
Now your finding out I won't ever change
I'm a keep grinding now you see I'm here to stay
I won't ever drop I won't walk away
I won't ever stop see I'm here to stay
To everybody that thought that I would fade away
Well here's a big fat God bless you have a nice day"

All About Money,Young Buck,Rap,"(Young Buck)
You a thug like me

You can catch me green stick it up,
Dick it up,
Cut a nigga shit over 50 bucks,
Need work on the low nigga hit me up,
Never quick enough after pickin' up,
Feds on a nigga block ridiculous,
'Cause the game done brought all our shit to us,
I done bit the dust-countinus
Now I ride double ? to the ind you bust,
Oh no wrong move if my ind you touch,
17 but its real when you playin' with much,
One in the chamber on the table when you chillin' for lunch,
And head up with your door open feelin' your blunt,
Where I'm from 20 gone by the end of the month,
I get drunk smoke the weed to the end of the blunt,
Make sure 10 shells done been in the pump,
If its on-first draw that's a nigga wit luck,
All niggas playin' games start endin 'em up,
'Cause your block young buck will start bendin 'em up,
As soon as your adrenaline pump,
Make way dear lord 'cause I'm sendin 'em up

It's all about money,
Gettin' major paid,
Stack your cheese in all different ways,
Tote your strap and keep your khakis creased,
Yeah nigga, you a thug like me?

(Verse 2 - D-tay)
They call me D-tays up
Get 'em up put the aks on,
Let 'em know we don't play sir,
Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,
Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,
Wanna play rough?
Y'all cats wanna play tough
Tay wanna spray stuff, erase stuff
Niggas wanna start shit with they gun then run,
Tay don't wanna chase ya,
Bullets wait ta, replace ya,
Hit 'em with the shells of the 45,
Make 'em all duck, with the four-five buck,
Put 'em all up,
Got 2 so we got you but we don't give a fuck,
Seals comin' gunnin out the cut,
Spittin' at you cats,
Spittin' 50 rounds like I'm spittin' on a track,
Y'all niggas know that you can't hold that,
Ima spit the gat till the gat click-clat,


Then chit chat,
Niggas gun learn that you beef with this here this heat gone burn,
Ima show ya cats how to bus y'all guns,
Hit a nigga up and leave his ass left numb,
Don't play with me,
You know I spray the heat,
The A.K. gun niggas down fatefully,
You think expectfully, just wait and see,
Young buck and D-tay nigga ready to g,
If it pays to be, the boss in the cause,
My gun so big gotta limp when I walk,
Don't talk the talk 'cause T.I.P. we comin',
First go about money

(Verse 3 - Young Buck)
It's all bout thuggin',
Gettin' paid and shit,
You either slang the dope or hit major licks,
That's why all my niggas be sevin bricks,
Y'all gunna see what we workin with,
Not me baby doll,
I ain't hurtin' for shit,
G.S. 400 with a leather kit,
Oh you don't wanna holla?
Well whatever bitch,
Don't say shit when the bezzle flip,
See a nigga tote straps for the hell of it,
I ain't givin' a fuck about jealous shit,
And I don't smoke weed for the smell of it,
Just before I kill, I inhale the shit,
You can't trail me bitch I be in 50 states,
Paranoid, with about 50 cakes,
Once a nigga find out it's all heart no shake,
That's when I infest the place,
I'm thugged out,
Up in the drug house,
Got it all-from the beer to a quarter ounce,
We da real ass niggas, all work no slouch,
Can I get that there? all that count,
All they amount,
But when it go down and a nigga make all ya say all that out,
What you gunna do nigga what you about,
Either ride or die, when I'm raised in the south,
Love the block, when a nigga wake up,
I wash my face and then hug my glock,
Brush my teeth and scream south side,
Smoke a blunt and put on my socks,
But it still don't stop, from dusk to dawn,
A nigga been out here on his own-livin' day to day,
See I'm only 17 but a nigga out here just gains farm"
Camouflage,C-Rayz Walz,Rap,"(Intro/Chorus)
""Don't camouflage, don't camouflage your feelings""
[Walz] Camouflage...
""Don't camouflage, don't camouflage your feelings""
[Walz] We all camouflage...
""Don't camouflage, don't camouflage your feelings""
[Walz] We all camouflage...
""Don't camouflage, don't camouflage your feelings""

(C-Rayz Walz)
From 41 shots, we +Dodge+ like +Neons+
Still smellin foul, from the bullshit we be on
More than words, YOU HEARD, the actions of speech
I seen a lot of things change, like blacks with money
Cats say they pack heat, but the boiler's broken
It's easy to be iced out when your mind's frozen
The proof is absolute truth, we call it raw
It rains and most still go chasin ""Waterfalls""
Excited by the night life, and the trife streets
I recall the pictures of Elijah, starin' at me
Now we hustle with the grim reaper, in gym sneakers
Phlegm speakers, when it comes to reefer it's deeper
WE WAS YOUNG FLOWERS, surrounded by weeds
Camouflaged feelings, blend in with the trees
Before degrees, I studied with the fiends in the park
And the fire from the crack pipe made the day dark
And it's still art!

(C-Rayz Walz)
You want wealth, search for self, find what you lookin' for
I got a Boogie Down mind, with a Brooklyn jaw
My Queens life through your eyes, my sneakers adjust size
The speakers through the rhymes (SOUND BETTER EQUALIZED)
Burn down buildings, pyramids, project piss
It's like life revolves around kicks, clips and script
Chicks in whips here's a tip, hollow ones'll split ya zipper
And the triggers get you stuck on the Island like Skipper
And the Gilligans'll kill again; blank spots? Fill 'em in
Tanktops? Mental men; train stops? Adrenaline
Rush hour change, seize the pain seeps
Run straight through every town like Main Street!
My brain keep the days of high-top fades, Gazelle shades
And MC's, gettin' live on stage
Gym star bar scar, act like you doin' time
See through the fine lines, cause the mind's designed as camouflage

(C-Rayz Walz)
Bulletproof gun-brellas, for the rain/reign of the tec
Rubber-gripped nines, when task split ya vest kiss ya chest
For the hell of it, I live where life is irrelevant
Dead friends stay in my head like elephant, memory
NECESSARY BY ANY MEANS, this too shall pass
Chalk outlines your body like a sick art class
Crack is 18 years old, so young but treacherous
The destruction of the hood is effortless, the error is
Mad kids be like YO, WHY SHE HAD ME?
AIYYO WHO DADDY IS? This my other baby daddy
What a fuckin' shame, I'm drunk in the rain, duckin the pain
My soldiers slang, I meditate with a migraine
You want my chain? I hope you know white crane
Or get flamed left in a puddle of money, maintain
I want change, tired of drugs and rats, thugs and gats
There's still love for you black, hip-hop and rap, it's camouflage

Count that for me... thanks

[Robotic voice] 4x
One, two, one, two, three, four

(Aesop Rock)
Well any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh
Make that sucker burn for days, I'll be impressed
Surf 'n' abash the cultured bigot, procreation baked in fanciful
Then scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill
I know girth and good nature but recognize absentee ballots
And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void
It's James and the giant Tugboat Complex and HE'S ANNOYED!
(No one's asking you to build an Ark, brother!)
Hmm, it's fashion
I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger wrapped in
Realigned mine eyes in divine justice
Plus this uncontrollable laugh with those amber waves of brain finally crash
Brimstone clone with legs and dim poems
Ten little Zen crafts
Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants
Picket well or ride a burner style clinic
Acid for the basics
P-H imbalance to burn the malice martyrs faceless
Then fabricate daytrips
I want to be the halo that jumps off the brain
Of the genius who decided some pictures deserved frames
(God and I are on a first name basis)
Yeah I call him God, he calls me Jesus
When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces
Blade, dragon, up hell's creek
Interrupting a devil pageant
Starfighter settling to madness
I keep my ghoul spirit concealed
Until the warriors return to the Coney Isle Wonder Wheel

My momma told me there'd be days like this
Days like this, days like this, days like this (yes she did)

[Robotic voice] 4x
One, two, one, two, three, four

(Aesop Rock)
Okay, tell me who you chill with and I'll tell you who you are
I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar
It's a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance
To sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen
This revolution pushing through the loose pins
And a strait-jacketed maverick classed in a bunk category
They had him parallel with a tattered glory division
(I could devil drink dreams out of thermos)
Yeah, with a whiskey afterburn
It's like, nine o'clock wake (I'm up) spit obscenities
My girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone then work my deviltry
The clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunderchaser set
That got my paper crane's wings wet
Voyeurist amendments lacked expansive coverage in the syllabus
I dance with chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post
I've done my chores according to God's schedule
With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals
Metal edged canes that tends to repel the bevel
Kettle screeching out the operetta
I live to autograph the iron curtain with dove's back feather pens
Spurting magma, cursing television earns the burdens of my Cleopatra
Minor (Major) dispersed slap on the wrist
For the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship
Sunk with a ""Yes sir""
Chained to fatigued ankle
Leagues beneath the angle
I'ma call home until the rock meets the angels

That's How It Is,Casual,Rap,"Yo!
Get the fuck off my dick and let me rip this shit!

I write raps,
And when niggaz bite, I clap,
'Cause their shit sounds better now.
You done let me down,
I thought it would be dope, but instead,
Your shit's dead,
You gets fed
To the alligators lurking in the moat,
Peep what I wrote,
You bit so hard, I though your shit was a quote.
But still I'm taxing, axing the competition,
And any wack men, I stomp and dis 'em
Easily.
And you can feel the pressure, plus
When I bust MCs'll be
Trampling eachother trying to exit,
When I flex it,
The way I wreck shit is not unexpected.
Niggaz just lose when I choose
The best crews of MCs,
And turn 'em into refugees.
I slaughter a lotta MCs that are the
?Styles I compiles?, and cut 'em up like ?vows?.
Think to yourself I write the shit
So you can bite the shit,
And I'll know, despite you get props.
(To da beat!)
Niggaz get dropped.

Sample: That's how it was and that's how it is!

Enough with this wackness,
Enough is my ?check?,
Enough with these motherfuckers biting DAS EFX.
I come real when I show skill,
(Hey, yo, Saafir!) You macked on that ho ill,
And that's for real, my flow still
Is everlasting, niggaz forever blasting
Shots when cash gets hot.
You're not fresh, so you hating when I be just
Ripping microphones without stating the obvious.
Now how much harder can it get?
Niggaz try to flow, but they soundin' like me
A year ago.
Shit, old, kaput, I got loot,
To the hos I'm cute, and so I always got boots.
It's me, so be free to feel the ?Ivy swing?,
More niggaz got my back than Rodney King.
I feel tight, knowing that the shit I write
Will be exposed to foes, and everyone will feel fright.
And you'll run and tell your man, ""Yo, peep this twist,
It's real, try to practise."" But the mack is
Way ahead of ya, instead of ya wack sound,
I'm kickin' shit to make MCs back down.
Got rhymes that kills, fills many empty heads,
Niggaz can be dead, I got 'em in line, like ?Stimpy?.
Red light, slow that shit down, bring it to a halt.
You're wack and it's all your fault"

I plug the ladies in
Mom kept the babies in
Do right Do right Do right Do right Do right {*3X*}

I plug the ladies in
Mom kept the babies in
Do right Do right Do right Do right Do right {*7X*}

I saw a dream flow slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
With jackles from every trade
With boogie faces from motors
She's walking beneath the rain
Connected by flesh extensions
While I've been through every puddle
My little walkers connected and...

I shout grate the biscuits
Grip the slip and repeat it
Baby boys in the puddle
And mothers sent us to pen again

This is the big fear
And I'm reaching up from the swamp in here
I'm taking away the trust
While the screaming can turn the a saint (?)

She wrote
Throw us out in a week
With a flash little man huddle
And infinite maternal wear
We used to sleep on cardboard

I stutter with chopped image
Of rapping while she listens to playing
I heard of trouble funk
Wake me with a sentence

I saw your dream flow slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
With Teddy Ruxpin cut daggers
And tusslin' with monster motors

You wouldn't stop water choking
He has that vein of magic
And I slip below the city far below the big erratic

I plug the ladies in
Mom kept the babies in
Do right... {*3X*}

I plug the ladies in
Mom kept the babies in
Do right Do right... {*3X*}

When I say he I mean I

When I say you I mean we
(Will prevail)
When I say she I mean God
(Give us strength)

Do right do right do right do right do right... {*5X*}

I saw your dream flow slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
Where emotions cause no emotions
A battle scar opens on
Mob smile
Dat style
The dance maneuvers of a little child
Look to the side lines where I shine upon my time

The physic declines through sharp finds and blood lines
Upon the heath the dew remains cold
Though the sun shines
The other: speak not of it
The moon will drag the oceans tide and then my heart will split

Back hunch
Eyes well
Thoughts mutilate a slide show
The darkest thoughts were used in a row
Where did the child go?

A kiss is floating throught the air but never landed
Will you accept all these excuses in exchange for understanding?

We saw a dream flow slow
Through the soluble hemoglobin
Where our love resembles clothing
And the beats are human clothing
And the thoughts of focus of consistence
Supersidal magic
I slip beyond myself into the realms of bad magic

I plug the ladies in
Mom kept the babies in

Verses From The Abstract,A Tribe Called Quest,Rap,"(Q-Tip)
I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...
Busta Rhymes in effect, Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

I'm movin, yes I'm groovin 'cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the mornin to avoid the funky odor
Can't help bein funky, I'm the funky Abstract brotha
Funky in a sense, but I play the undacova
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm gettin' funky and my rappin', that's my duty
Brothas tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothas, then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy makin' bucks
Girls love the jim, 'cause it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the (uh!) 'cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swings, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothas dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we thrive it for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensils
Write my rhymes straight up, don't get with no fancy stencil
The rhymes we get is sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perkin up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is comin' up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, I deep instilled the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a claker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I used that to break her

(Vinia Mojica singing in the background)
Phife is in the house, Uncle Mike is in the house
Bob Power is in the house, Tim Latham is in the house
Wise Men is in the house, The Brand Nubes is in the house
The Jay Bee, they in the house and De La, they in the house

I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the '90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothas Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
Is the funky singin' by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff 'cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug 'cause their beats are hard but gentle
Afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and your comin' to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexin is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speakin', the hard beats is reachin'
The Black and Puerto Ricans
'Cause their butt naked, streakin through the ever murky streets
Of the urbanized areas
Blastin out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

Craig is in the house, Pete Rock is in the house
CL is in the house, Ultra Mag is in the house
Nice and Smooth is in the house, Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house, Special Ed is in the house

Yeah (*7X*)
This one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
Now check it out

Something Inside My Head,Akala,Rap,"They wonder why the caged bird sings
But even worse a pain
Is the bird with lead wings
It's like I'm on my own town
But can't speak the language
Crowded to the point of suffocation
Still feel stranded
What bandage could heal scars invisible
Existing is easy it's living that is difficult
It's like a ritual
I get close to believing
Then I put a fortress up to close in my feelings
Dreaming, so close to achieving
Then I throw it all away
'Cause I'm scared to receive it
Living every day in my shadow
I find my resolve
When the cold night swallows that shadow
I travel through the landscape
Searching for why
But the question follows everywhere I go
Like the sky
You don't understand my soul
Well neither do I

It's just something inside my head
Won't set me free
Won't let me be
It's just something inside my head
Comin' in between you and me
It's just something inside my head

I wasn't born this way
My condition was learned
Once bitten twice shy I don't wanna be burned
When you travel a passage
That leaves your soul ravaged
Your mind waxes placid to limit the damage
Your reaction is passive
Whether you like it or not
You cannot win whether you fight it or not
Your brain swallows the pain and buries it instead
Now...

It's just something that guides my
Something that drives my
Something inside my head

I offend myself then avenge myself
And pretend it helps to defend myself
I believe myself then deceive myself
To retrieve myself I don't need my help
Whether the brave myself or slave myself
It's strange every day I'm not the same myself
I love myself then I hate myself"

Time To Make A Change,Goldie Lookin Chain,Rap,"Time for the GLC to make a change innit

Lookin' back, times they was whack
I used to steal from my grandma, my style was so slack
Nothing I could do to stop sucking on a brew (?)
If I kept on this way next stop was the glue
Had to get away, had to find a way out
So I raised up my fist and gave a GLC shout

Tidy

Lookin' back, I was on the edge
But I had to make a pledge
To the GLC, 'cause you knows they'll set you free
And if you open your eyes you can see
You knows it
1983 to the present day
Safe as fcuk
Knows it

Yeah, the GLC saved a lot of people's lives
Stopped a lot of people getting stabbed with big knives
All these people here in one big crew
... (?) Between me and you
We wanna stop all the violence on the streets
We wanna get the kids together
Wanna make 'em feel sweet
We gotta stop all the stuff that's goin' on

2000 AD was a bad boy you see
That's what they said back in early '83
It wasn't my fault, my father was a boozer
He used to beat me up and said I was a loser
But times they have changed
My style's less insane
'Cause I sees the light in the Goldie Lookin' Chain
Big shout out to DCI Burnside

It's time to make a fresh start

Cousin of Death,La Coka Nostra,Rap,"(Everlast)
Glory fades and glory days ain't always what they seem
Give all I got and make my salaat and dream my broken dreams
I crawl inside, ball up and hide, tuck my pain away
And hope to God I fall into a sleep where I can stay

We all got bills to settle, we all got a price to pay
And if I make it through the night I can fight another day
They say it's better to burn out than it is to fade away
I just hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay

(Slaine)
It was a couple of years ago that I started becoming numb
No one could understand where all my words were coming from
Having visions of a nine-to-five, a wife, a blunt, a son
Of a life of hustle getting by with some of the running gun
Is it best to be a crumb? My ex says he's a bum
Lashing out in violence whenever my destiny it hung
In the balance, rum, I'm drinking gallons, some think that my flows
Are more poetic than the poems of Edgar Allen Poe
But I know that I'm at a challenge though
I can hold an old Calico to my dome and let my talents go
Shit, I spent my whole life around the violence so
I planted seeds of hate oh I let my habits grow
I slept with the homeless, I copped with the fiends
Lost the love inside my heart, I even forgot what it means
Seen the ripest nights turn into the rottenest schemes
But through it all I have never forgotten my dreams

(Everlast)
When the gutters fill with blood that's spilled from friends that pass away
And memories of eulogies while standing by their graves
Just trying to survive we wind up living lives like slaves
I hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay

We all got beef to settle, we all got demons to slay
And if I pray all through the night I can fight another day
They say it's better to burn out than it is to fade away
I just hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay

(Ill Bill)
Rest in peace to my homie Sob
I stand before an altar of open sepultures and coffins
I heard Javier got killed, it didn't seem real
With an army of goons drinking straight vodka to deal
We live and die by the gun, wear our hearts on our sleeves
Even though our compassion's destined to die on the streets
What's left over a cold hollow murder machine
With an appetite for malevolence, perversion, and greed
When one of us dies we don't really learn anything
Outside the funeral doing bumps, burning trees
Plotting revenge, crying over fallen angels
Sometimes your friends die the most awkward strangers
I can't lie, sometimes this life makes me a stranger to myself
But I'm pulling myself together, it's bigger than just me
As I spit this bear witness to truth
My unborn seed listens while I spit in the booth

(Everlast)
Glory fades and glory days ain't always what they seem
Give all I got and make my salaat and dream my broken dreams
I crawl inside, ball up and hide, tuck my pain away
And hope to God I fall into a sleep where I can stay

We all got bills to settle, we all got a price to pay
And if I make it through the night I can fight another day
They say it's better to burn out than it is to fade away
I just hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay"

Paradise,Eyedea & Abilities,Rap,"What a beautiful world, so fragile and fertile
Pain filled the void when boy met girl
He's a puppet to nature, one year later
Now so deeply and sickly in love it makes him hate her
The average romanticized American relationship
Sinks, capsized when either side becomes a slave to it
Conditioned, dependent, afraid to be alone
He needs that feeling that he can't create all on his own
He despises the fact she has a life outside of them
It drives him crazy to think she's not insanely consumed with him
Give her the guilt-trip and maybe she'll quit living
To stay behind his prison walls and lose all individualism
Well this is happiness, masochistic torture
Plagued by the decadent crave for affection
The needle digs deep to push contentment through his bloodstream
And drown out hollow, the pothole of a junkie
If he could only hear her sing, he wouldn't want to break her wings
But emptiness has such a warm, subtle sting
She makes up for what he lacks, trapped
He can't imagine life without someone like that

We've rediscovered the long-lost art of dying
Only the lonely resent angels for flying
Twisted, living off of each other's sickness like parasites
This is paradise

We've rediscovered the long-lost art of dying
Only the lonely resent angels for flying
Addicted, afraid to take control of my own life
This is paradise

What a beautiful world, emotionally destroyed
Her became plural when girl met boy
Between several breakups and plenty relapses
Routine bred-comfort led to serious attachment
Now every once in a while she forgets to breathe
Terrified of losing him, paradise is misery
Too much faith in the life-saving knight in shining armor
Now her knight's noticing the scars she can't hide any longer
But they were her story way before he was
It's gross hope to think he would heal such deep cuts
At first it felt so right but after one too many fights
He turned out that hallway light and all the wonder turned to spite
So they sleep in the same bed with guns to each others' heads
Dead to romance, boiling the blood that painted roses red
Suffering from post-honeymoon disease
Bleached through his whole existence, she'll die if he decides to leave
Addicted to the way she feels when they spend time together
Detouring the now in a childish attempt to find forever
Despite the fact they hold each other heart to heart
You can't be that close to somebody without being so far apart

Silence is the most obscure sound I've ever heard
Those lonely, giant spaces in between your every word
And maybe, I'm totally crazy for holding on but
Just 'cause I'm insane, don't mean that I'm wrong
Now that you're gone I can't sleep at night
I barely even function right, my memory's on overdrive
Too hungry and too cold to cry
Miss the companionship I once took for granted
The way you helped me manage, the partnership that vanished
But I don't expect you to stay chained by the ankle
There's so much world to see so, fly free my angel
I'm dying without you, but it's teaching me to live
Heaven ain't something someone else can give
It's all inside of me

There's so much world to see
What's stopping me from flying free?
There's so much world to see
What's stopping you from flying free?

Last Song,Looptroop,Rap,"""I write with a great vengeance.
Sort of like I'm innocent facing a death sentence,
Like I might not even finish my next sentence,
Like all I got left to live is ten seconds.
The clock's ticking this could be my last song,
My last will if you will before I pass on.
I'd like to pass on some words that a last long,
And mean something even after rap's gone.
Despite all the wickedness in the wilderness,
And the fact that my life kind of been a mess,
If I die tomorrow I feel no bitterness.
No sorrow and not one bit of stress.
I'm feeling blessed that I made it this far,
My 26th year, my 14th bar.
I see the sunshine, feel the bass line.
Listen to it tellin' us not to waste time...

'Cause if I'd die tomorrow,/ I'd feel no kind of sorrow./ I'd smile at my memories,/ and pray for my enemies.

Man, tough I'm sad I had to go and all, I'm so glad I got to know you all.
Don't feel bad, I hope I told you all
We had one hell of a ride so far.
If I did die, oh Lord, no need to cry, oh Lord
'Cause I've been around. And been around friends who's been around since
My story begins, seen my flaws and my sins.
I had the women, loved them all. Most the bads was my fault!
Hope you forgive me and remember me by our happiest memories.
I tend to be afraid to give my heart away,
But you was my light, and if It's dark today, I know you'll rise and shine someway!
I went away on my way up, but that's a good way to leave!
Believe me when I say - You made it easy being me!

And mom, you taught me how to see things from the bright side.
That's why my brother survived, why you and dad stayed tight
Though you divorced and broke up. Now I ran outta luck
But I know you grow stronger when the going gets tough!
Hope I made you proud, hope you didn't worry too much,
About my drinking and drugs, it never came between us.
Didn't keep no secrets, always told you about stuff.
And I know you know I love you, and to me that's enough...

So if I die rich and famous in the hall of fame,
Or in a prison nameless with a ball and chain.
Sky high above the clouds and the fallin' rain.
Makin' love to my woman hear her call my name,
Or bangin' my head against a brick wall in pain.
If the last days of my life I was called insane,
It's all love 'cause it's all the same,
And if I'd get a new life nothing at all I'd change...

I wouldn't undo it if I could - hell maybe I should,
But it's one life to live, one love - it's all good.
Think I did ok at least enjoyed it while it lasted.
Think of how we laughed shit I'm smilin' in my casket.
Though I may have caused some beefs, and indeed I regret all,
May have pissed off my peops. Best believe I won't forget y'all,
When I'm chillin' in hiphop heaven or spittin' burners in hell,
I hope you got your health and you're at peace with yourself.
Became older and wiser I hope you toast to my name.
I sit beside you guys even when my bones in the grave.
I got so much more to say, but this the end of the song,
So just rewind the tape and don't mind singin' along... come on!

If this is the last song,/ and these are last days./ If the show really can't go on,/ then I'm catching the last train. X2"""

Now there's Gangsta-ism, and tribalism
I'm only fuckin', wit survivalism
Fo-fo to the dome' is my religion, Now wha's yours
Pray, before I bust yours...

Woo! La la laa la la la la la la la, gangsta...
Woo! La la laa la la la la la la la, I'm a gangsta...

Every time I come around bitches starin' at me
Pointing there go Mack 10 from the Dub S-C
Wit a L.A. fitted hat and a fresh white tee
Fulla flair and pizzazz but I'm a straight up G
Cocky 'cause I'm rich, look good and I know it
But I'm confused on what to be, a d-boy or poet
Head is mandatory, bitch, there's so much to blow it
If I do fall for you I refuse to show it
So if you think I ain't pimpin', Man that shit is absurd
I stay hard on 'em, fulla 'izm, fuck what chu heard
You say you down for me, shit but that's only words
Wanna show me love bitch, hop on tha plane wit a bird
So regardless of the weather, bitch go on get this chedda'
And keep big daddy ridin' two-three's or betta
Wood on the dash wit the peanut-butta' leather
And like that Al Qaeda love we can blow up togetha', Holla...

Bandit Queen,Looptroop,Rap,"Ey yo, bust it, when the police come, yo, she ready for whatever
Never talk to the cops 'cause she got her mind together
A down to earth mother earth living at the speed of life
She don't need a ring to be my wife
A truly independent woman, not a destiny's child
Not depending on money or fashion to have style
She got nuff style - rough style - diamond in the rough
Not a dimepiece in the back, she a diamond in the front
Seat by my side, ready to ride
With a smile on her face when she let me inside
What is this? I need a gangsta bitch, I need love
I need a ride or die bitch? None of the above
I need a terrorist chick taking care of this dick
Ain't nothing superficial like marriage and shit
A truly holy matrimony, she my homie
I forget about this evil world when she hold me

She love love like I do
She need sex like I do
She love freedom like I do
She need music like I do

And yo, I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
A real woman that can bring out the man in me
I said a bandit queen (what, a bandit queen)
Independent enough so she can handle me
Ey yo, a bandit queen (yes, a bandit queen)
She the mother of humanity
I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
She look good, but she not into vanity

I need a riot girl, not a violent girl
But one that knows how to defend herself when they try to quiet her
In this manmade era of gangrapes and terror
Where most men can't face the mirror
She overcome 'cause she positive
She live in love and she love to live
She love to give and love to take
She don't compete 'cause she above the fake
She don't deal with no silly silicone
Even when I'm not with her I don't really feel alone
'Cause there's a metaphysical bond between us
Strong as my penis want the Venus
I need the butts and no maybes
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my babies
You know what I mean?
Wanna roll with my team well you know what I need

I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
Independent enough so she can handle me
I said a bandit queen (what, a bandit queen)
A real woman that can bring out the man in me
Ey yo, a bandit queen
She look good, but she not into vanity
I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
She the mother of humanity

I need a bandit queen but man it seems
That the whole world is living in some candy dream
They want a plastic screen - not flesh and blood
They want some bad machine - not blessed love
They're stressed enough for ulcers and bloodclouts
Grey hairs and great fears of what nots
I feel alone in this cold world
But out of 5 billion people there should be a soulgirl
My soulmate, not afraid to hold weight
Baby your soulfood, I love it homemade
The way you stir it up I ain't coming home late
Your recipe is so tasty - give me the whole plate
(Come on) Give me the whole plate
(Come on)

She love love like I do (Blessed love)
She need sex like I do (Aha)
She love freedom like I do (Freedom)
She need music like I do (Come on)

I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
Independent enough so she can handle me
I said a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
A real woman that can bring out the man in me
I need a bandit queen
Hey, she ain't living in no fantasy
I need a bandit queen (yo, a bandit queen)
Yes, pullin' me in like bravendy
I need a bandit queen"
Sound of Philadelphia,Reef the Lost Cauze,Rap,"Yeah
It's the sound of Philadelphia
Yo, yo

Welcome to the home of brotherly love
Brothers covered in blood
The man's office is covered in bugs
The youth dreams cut short, swept under the rug
Love for self is outweighed by the love for the drugs
Go Eagles, McNabb and T.O.
We ain't hard to find homey, just follow the weed smoke
We eat rolls of greased beef soaked, overweight and evil
A city of justice unequal
The shadow of New York we still under
So we gotta kill 'em every summer, walk a little tougher
Guns bustin' how we chose to fight
When you can go from bein' a star to a scumbag overnight
Streets often deserted on the coldest nights
All hair trigger thunderbirds show you're right
Cops don't ask if ya know your rights
Hopeless hypes smokin' pipes
Pavement gamblers rollin' dice
Short sentence describe your whole life
Low expectancy at a low price for a low life
The mind of many years shines, soul so bright
But they could give a fuck, in their crib no lights
Everybody rhyme and they claim they don't write--it down
Sit down, take it all in
Civilization, this is where it all ends
The city I call kin
Yo, so take caution

It's the sound of Philadelphia
Gun shots and pretty beats
Come along with me, hear my city speak
It's talkin' to ya, it's giving you a heads up
It's sayin' that niggaz 'round here is gettin' fed up

On stoops the fruits of my labor
Are made by moves that major
Hood gossip never news from the newspaper
Don't ask me for shit, we never do favors
The elders are now just a bunch of reclused neighbors
Tax dollars go to prisons, new judges, new chambers
Love it when you lose, kill ya if you came up
Niggaz passin' disease, fuckin' the same slut
You either cuttin' a demo or gettin' 'caine cut
Don't go to school, they'll treat you like a lame duck
You ain't my master, yeah it's a shame but
What do you expect from--kids who need respect
'Cause no one was at home for them to learn respect from?
We respect guns, we respect funds
Let's face it, my future don't look like the Jetsons
Don't ask the government for help 'cause we expect none
Our heroes get murdered and replaced with the next one
It's like a wild west done
On the way out I hope I get one
But I doubt that will happen
'Cause of crabs in a barrel
I'll probably end up in a cage
'Cause I had to let a blast from the barrel
The city of Philly {*echoes*}

It's the sound of Philadelphia
Gun shots and pretty beats
Come along with me, hear my city speak
It's talkin' to ya, it's giving you a heads up
It's sayin' that niggaz 'round here is gettin' fed up"
Guilty,Remy Ma,Rap,"(Remy ma:)
He put the gun in my hand
I took my hand and put the gun in my pants
I took my pants and pulled them up on my ass
I got the cash out my pocket dropped it
And got my ass outta dodge
Put into the car started it stepped on the gas
Looked at the dash see 95 really seem fast when you so fucking mad and so fucking high
And you can't stop crying
Oh shit I just ran a stop sign fuck it its nothing
This nigga got me stressing
I can't believe he got me bugging
Now I'm driving reckless I can't even see and my high beams ain't even helping
But nobody be really using the streets before 7
I got the pedal to the metal like I lost my mind
And I ain't even see the school crossing sign
Car in the faster gear wind blowing in my hair
Seat belt, light blinking, but I don't care
Somebody crossing the street cam outta no where
Ran right into them body flew in the air
Oh my GOD my face already covered with tears
Saying my prayers I ain't even say I swear
I thoguht off of reflex saw blood every where
Mostly around the head of the litlle girl holding a teddy bear
I'm sorry all I can hear is I want my mommy
Then I ain't hear nothing from the little girls body
I'm scared but I can't stop what I'm gon do
First thing the cops gon say was that it was drug influence
They ain't gon understand what this nigga was doin'
How he made me drive fast when I should've be cruising
And they probably ain't gon believe that it wasn't they weed and shorty
Just popped up in the middle of the street
And they really gon be hating wit this gun on my waist
And I checked shorty pulse and I don't think she gon make it
Dial 911 or damn should I run
I'm just weighing out my options before some body come
If I stay I go to jail if I run I'll be wrong
This is taking to long
Fuck it I'm gone

Hit and run
Damn I shoulda hit my brakes
Hit and run
Sometimes we all make mistakes
Hit and run
I guess I'm not that heartless
Hit and run
'Cause now I got a guilty conscience"
Magician's Assistant,Dan Le Sac vs Scroobius Pip,Rap,"It's tragic; you tried to cut yourself in half,
But this isn't magic; in fact it's something much more dark, or more dramatic
Self harm, that's what they call it.
'Cause it just affects you.
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do,
And if one day you can't rein it in,
And of your last breath you are the only witness,
Then so be it, 'cause it's your last breath,
And it's nobody else's business.
But, how about your little sister?
I mean, you think your life's been bad,
And by no means am I belittling that,
'Cause I know the troubles you've had
But a teen finding out her big sister chose death over life,
Finding out instead of turning to her with your problems, You turned to a knife
That's a whole lot of pain to deal with,
And a whole lot of damage
And the only role model she has is little more than words engraved in granite.
But as you said before, this just affects you.
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do.
And if one day you can't rein it in,
And of your last breath you are the only witness,
Then so be it, 'cause it's your last breath,
And it's nobody else's business.
But then, how about your parents?
God knows they've done all they can to support.
Yeah, you didn't go up in a mansion,
But they gave you the best life they could afford,
And the second that last bit of life tickles out,
And your lungs cease to breath,
They've fail the most important task that they will ever receive.
They failed to give their child a life that's worth living,
And that's a failure as long as they live, of themselves, is unforgiving.
But as you said before, this just affects you.
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do.
And if one day you can't rein it in,
And of your last breath you are the only witness,
Then so be it, 'cause it's your last breath,
And it's nobody else's business.
But, how about your friends?
How did they fail to see this coming?
I mean, you can only hold so much pain,
And recently it seems like the tap's been left running.
Families grow distant, but it's meant to be your friends you can rely on.
They shouldn't be there for just fun and drinks.
They should be the shoulder to cry on.
They should be the ones you turn to,
When you can't talk to your family.
But they failed to because although you didn't ask for their support,
It should have been mandatory.
But as you said before, this just affects you.
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do.
And if one day you can't rein it in,
And of your last breath you are the only witness,
Then so be it, 'cause it's your last breath,
And it's nobody else's business.
But then, what about me?
What kind of boyfriend am I?
Instead of living a life I was a big part of,
You would rather die.
Instead of fighting though together,
And turning things around,
You decided the grass is greener
On the other side of the ground.
Of our shared lives there was nothing worth living for as far as you could see.
So if that's the case for you
Then what is there left in this life for me?
But as you said before, this just affects you.
It's your life, your body, your sister, your parents, your friends, and your partner
So you can choose what you do.
And if one day you can't rein it in,
And of your last breath you are the only witness,
Then fuck everybody else cause that ain't something you've got to live with

In a fantastic place where you are what you eat

Forced when I'm sober, forced when I'm drunk

Give 'em time to jump to the orchestra
Battle axe warriors
Throw you around like raggady dolls
No one answers when the majesty of tragedy calls
Rhyme assault is easy to spot
Check the weight of the victim and the type of knot
Tackle your whole crew with the talon of a hawk
Drink in my hand, probably gin on the rocks
I'm the centre of the universe kill a verse if I'm hot
Yo, to tell you the truth, I'm the duke of the dark
Double sided mirrors and frosted breath
My reputation for rocking sets is darker than death

Les starts to rip shit
Beatnuts makin' crazy noise with some hip shit
24-track, e.q.-ed to attack
Pump mo' watts than any Radio Shack
Black, I stick to bein ruff and rugged
Anti-pop, I guess I'll stay broke (Fuck it!)
A crazy hispanic, Psycho Les panic
Nah, not me, I just pull the automatic
Out the knapsack, and cold point it
Blast ya, and leave your punk-ass disjointed
Yo, I ain't goin' out like a punk
Nothin' but fat rhymes and beats for your trunk to pump
I make you wanna jump like Kris Kross
(Beatnuts gonna blow up!) Slow down on that Crazy Horse
My hand's tied from the mic it holdes
I'ma jet up the block before the record shop closes

(Verse 2: v.i.c.)
V.I.C., droppin' styles you ain't used to
Nice with the lyrics, when I produce I get looser
Beats I got plenty, they come a dime a dozen
I got more beats than Puertoricans got cousins
Diggin every day, I'm the breakbeat doodle
I got the funky shit, ask my main man Ju-Ju
Jump in the trunk, we Audi on a mission
(Guess where we're goin'?) Philadelphia, beat-fishin
There's always one store niggas always get stuck on
I know a lotta spots that are ain't puttin' ya up on
Find your own beats, you're a real snuffalafagus
Lazy muthafucka, you're always bummin off of us
You know there's no one finer
Diggin for shit from here to North Carolina
The name is V.I.C., it's time to dilly-dally
First I hit Texas, then I'm 'goin' back to Cali'

Ill with the grooves, it's the real beat-digger

But if I can't afford to pay, I'll bag it
You can laugh and joke, but you'll never see me smile
Ruff and rugged, kickin the hardcore freestyle
Flavor-filled funk, bust the way I word it
Punks who pop junk, kid, tend to get murdered
Not a violent kid, though
Prefer to freak the flow, check it
Loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Face it, here's somethin' to make you jump around
(Jump around!) And 'get down, get down'
Honeys always sock me tryin' to get my attention

The Prayer V,DMX,Rap,"Let us pray
Father thank you for makin' me righteous
And accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection
Your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with
+IS+ my favorite shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special privileges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything
That the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries
And an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turn-arounds and miraculous breakthroughs
In the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by unGodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws
Are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight
Because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time the designated moment
For me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf
In Jesus MIGHTY name we have prayed; Amen, and Amen"
She Said (Jay Dee Remix),The Pharcyde,Rap,"(Slim Kid3)
I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't keep love lonely
Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next
And not necessarily the sex
And one might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulating breakin down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously
Curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in
Behind these fantasies with no action
Searchin for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desire's on fire
Quick is the fuse anotha love's for hire

(2X)
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really goin' down
Up on the northside of town Of course I bought the quarter pound
Of bomb hemp feelin' all right like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night lookin' right 'cause my shit is tight
Blazin' blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp wit an izass more amazin' than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say ""How ya doin'"" she says ""Hey I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to mackin to baby to see what's crackin'
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attackin
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabber and jibben
Fibbin and adlibbin just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed bumpin some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said ""oh like that? You know I don't get down""
I know my homies gonna clown 'cause I let her stick around when...

She said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

(T. Hardson)
Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night
So we could be alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Tryin' to build something real Working fingertips to the bone
So much love's gone astray that it won't be comin' home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouettes beneath the moon
And she said if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothin' else could come between the flight of a new love baby
Yeah, maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharin' this here ship with the fools...
You know ? (that) ... Right now... right now... right now... right now...
Baby... Right now... right now... right now... baby...

Thing or two to say, although the

Thing that you should fear because the
Answers to it all whether things

Truth remains the same
And that truth is that God is change

How could it be that it can't be?
So alone

Releasing Hypnotical Gases,Organized Konfusion,Rap,"(Pharoahe Monch)
As you look from whenceforth I come; riding the wind
Thus eliminating competition from bird's-eye view, I'm
Descending in helicopters -- in a village raid
Flesh will burn when exposed to the poetical germ grenade
I'm highly intoxicating your mind -- when I'm operating
On cell walls to membranes, cytoplasms to protoplasms
Disintegrate 'em eliminate 'em now no one has 'em in battle
I display a nuclear ray that'll, destroy bone marrow in cattle
Thereby destroying the entire food supply
That's crawling with AIDS, maggots, flies
It's ironic, when a demonic, government
Utilizes bionics and a six million dollar man to capture me
Clever, however; you could never ever begin to apprehend a hologram
Who's determined to fight solely, to defend in wars a land of the holy
I threw I-raq/a-rock and I-ran/I-ran
'Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the depths of the sand
So don't ask me Hu-ssein/who-sane
Cause the hypnotical gases are eating my brain"

Slug: (Verse 1)

Uh Huh, her name was Stephanie something
She lived out in Richfield, Right off of Portland
I'm talkin' bout back in the 9th grade
Still had a ponytail, Couldn't grow a (hi fay?)
Used to take the 5 way out to the Suburbs
Waitin at the bus stop there was my love bird
She would get on, sit down, scoot me over
And smile with a jerry curl, resting on my shoulder
And we would hit the mall together, maybe hold each others hands, or share a Doctor Pepper,
And all we ever did was kiss, no sex
But in our defense there was never any stress

Background Singing:(Chorus)

(Your number one) X4

Slug: (Verse 2)
On the phone late at night, when I'm supposed to be in bed, momma doesn't know I'm talkin' to Laynette
I had a lot, sweet nothin' to say, You could say not a whole lot has changed since this day
We was 14, but she had breast, although, we was both to young for anything sexual
Just wanted her to know that she was special
She used to write me notes,""Do you like me, Yes?, No?""
And I don't know if it was practice for later
But both of us would break our back to spend time together
I don't ever remember trying to make her feel bad
Back then, we didn't see things like that

Background Singing: (Chorus)

Slug: (Verse 3)
There used to be a spot called the Boulevard Theater and as a kid when a movie came out I would see it there
Sneakin in to the ""R"" rated feature
I think I was 15 that's how I met Lisa
She showed up, with a group of fly girls
So and me and my crew was in super fly world
After the flick we went outside, paired off, took a walk, into that night
I can't imagine that happening now
The innocence is gone and all the magic ran out
I wonder if my son will get to understand the fun that comes from the summer with the one you call the one

Background Singing: (Chorus)

Slug: (Verse 4)
They used to be a fear and a nervousness but back then it wasn't because of domestic disturbances
It used to just hurt your heart, But now it's not enough until it rips your universe apart
Got to see a lot of love when I was a kid
Heartbreak made me want to die, but I never did
So this is for my old baby sitter, wanted to sneak out and fall asleep by the lake with ya
Smells like candy, felt like family, For every girl that ever helped me in the back seat
Used to vision being love struck with them
Till I got blindsided by these grown up women

Check this out, Cool DJ Red Alert
With my man, Q-Tip and Shaheed

Q-Tip:
In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go...
On with the program
Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brotha who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?
The Pubic Enemy

Red Alert:
Pubic Eeeeeenemy!
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy
Ay, Q-Tip

Q-Tip:
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
'Cause I see the king with my very own eye
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
And poppin' up on the teammates scene
And poppin' and pimpin' on hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to me, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick
The thought of cheatin' made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin
You could hear him yellin' in the motherland
""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.""
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...
Of the enemy The Pubic Enemy

Q-Tip and Red Alert:
Propmaster (yeah) Please listen to me (what?)
Something lurkin by the JimBrowski
(Who? Jenny?) No, not propulated

He gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya

(What? Yo listen here.
Propmaster whiz, no one fears...)
Oh, the caves know, just thought I'd let ya know
How he lives and how he go
Watch yourself when you're out on the run
The enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad
And laid up this girl, so now, they're sad
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...

Sparklin' like a towerin' inferno
You wanna' learn my songs, This ain't no journal
It blemished my rhyme, Because I'm drawin' the line
Don't celebrate too soon, 'cause I'm goin' for mine
Just a character in a made up cartoon
Like Witchel and hazel, Boy, you're pushin' a broom
So get a new life or come equipped with the best
Mark another one for Ice, let the microphone rest
Just listen to my groove, the beat is strong
And I'll rock it now, I need a microphone
I'm in the mood to dance, I'm in the mood to prance
You tried me once but now you're takin' a chance
Because I rock with flavor, Hard as lifesaver
You asked for dope, Ha... That's what I gave ya'
A chance to go but now you move too slow
My juice is pumped and I'm ready to go



Real good... Into a new phase, jumpin' up the airwaves
And now you're amazed 'cause it's hip hop that you crave
Because I'm hyped like an addict, there's no drug involved
The only thing I need is my record revolved
Def comin' dtrong, hard like a matador
I saw my style, my soul, up on the dance floor
I wanna' see ya' shake, shake and shiver
You're a charity case, and Ice is the giver
I'm givin' you what you want but you're dumb and naive
You can't cope with the dop Ice has conceived


Which is a dope jam, hotter than the third degree
You tried my style but I burn you see
I'm Ice and I'm cold, I'm buildin' igloos of gold
You wanna' bite my style, you gotta' have soul
'Cause a dope like this is not easy to come by
You don't buy it on, it comes out your HiFi



You think it's funy to lack but I'm a brother to Mack
The 808 kickin' base from a dope drum track
I'm the coolest of cool, kickin' cools silly fools
You r posse's takin' a dip and Vanilla's the pool
Get ready for my ritual, it's at its' peak
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak
Intruders get slayed, My pockets get paid
The girlie is jockin' it and just got laid
See I'm the press you elect, Keep the record erect
In effect, damn, ain't that what you expect?
Earthquake is on the funk, My homie's not a punk
Take you antique rhymes and self 'em as junk
You see, we won't come front' and sellin' drugs and all that shit
Fake caddies, mack daddies, ain't even legit
So, get a beeper, you're a sleeper and you need to wake up
So make the record transform so Carwin Vegas



Do it! We don't need no music
'Cause all we wanna' do, Is sing and dance and party down
I'm the best, He's the Vanilla"

For your consideration, as the world turns
As the world turns, you read in all these scriptures
About the world, find out that the world does turn!""

As the world keeps spinning, we live these days
Dollar bill done drove the whole world crazy
While sitting on the porch letting ganja blaze
Never hesitate a moment to enhance my phrase
Since I needed that escape I take my pull
Seen the thugs on the corner trying to act all cool
Pretty much out of character
I look right through, their transparent exterior
You in my book getting written and I'm the derriere
Thought you was peeping me but I was aware of ya
You peep my ill expressions, how I just glare about
Trying to trace my inner world and my whereabouts
Well try on, try on
I'm watching everything that's going down
And it ain't nothing that I ain't been around
The same ghetto but a different town
Weeell, I remember growing up in the P-a-c
It was a whole lot of love in my family
I had clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
Times we didn't have a lot but that was fine with me
In good times and even bad times
Whether rainy, grey sky or the sunshine
Life was so much simpler, I didn't realise it then
But time has definitely made me a wiser man

(Chorus 2x: Erinn Anova)
The world keeps turning round
And time just keeps on moving

Sunday morning in the church just singing a song
Mama gave much praise cause her soul was strong
When I was young I used to do lots of thangs was wrong
I never thought about till one day she was gone
Now my daddy passed on about a year before
Reminiscing as I glance at the fishing pole
But these things gotta happen so we all can grow
And now they spirits much freer than they was befo'
So fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on
Cause there's angels in the midst
And they're guiding and watching me every day
And even though at times I let it get to me
Just a little and I go astray
We keep marching on and on
Young militants will watch and now we're growing
With kids of their own, as it all unfolds
As the world keeps turning on, the world keeps turning on

This one goes out to family, y'all come first

A rude mannerism
To intrude on those held back by inhibitions
If the myth that keeps you warm
Fails to feel secure by superstition
Everything else steering charted to the unknown
Sweet receiver, iconoclast
Bubbles like bath, where intricate broadcasts
Experiments like lab rats
Pack heat like a thermos, intrinsic
Act on instinct, invalids extinguished
Stink like N'Sync, I exist as contradiction
Taking your silence as conformation

Silver heat

MC for modern classic, conceptual
From you empty gestures, cosmetic
Many weathers apart
When you're a pitter it patters like wallpaper
Floppy cock, vagrants, a vapor, vanquished
Empty parking lot vacant and vanished
Just as light bulbs make love and burn themselves out
Obviously you're not stingy with stupidity
Conceited, and your album's only one song strong
Chew your arm off and and raise your hand
Appreciation is just as impractical
As masculinity for drag queens
In the game of role reversal
And billy graham conducting the hell's angels at a choir rehearsal
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
And celebrate every day as new year's
Is lookin' in the mirror to watch my balls drop

Four, three, two, one

Silver heat"
Dedicated,Rakim,Rap,"You and me (You and me)
We used to be together (Used to be)
Everyday together (Everyday)
Always (Always)

You was dead from the beginning, all I had to do was survive
In a race against millions where they lose they die
?
?
At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide
I found heaven in you, You shared your light with me
Gave me insight way before the light hit me
It's more than just a bone 'cause we inseparable
Even when they cut the cord on the ambilocal
Never martyred a moment away
And fix whatever was wrong and always know what to say
The same way to my sisters and brothers
Always honest, and showed me what unconditional love is
The voice of a goddess, the stars twinkle in your eyes
My heaven on Earth or angel in disguise
If you was here I'd just hug and kiss you
'Cause to me words can't explain how much I miss you

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always

I watched the ladies shine, and stay on their grind
While the world weighed heavy on the lady's mind
It was a crazy time
It's like the world stopped fast with pap's pass in '89
The harder we cry, the harder you cry too
?
It's hard to keep going, the harder you try to
?
You tried to be strong and keep the fam together
?

While you smile with your open arms
?
You said it takes some time, take it slow, but time will take it's toll
And the stakes is high, till the day you die
But I refuse to accept eventually that I would have to say goodbye

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

I'm starting to see how short life is
Every second it gets shorter, but your heart get warmer
And you get stronger
Even when they said you need a transplant and dialysis to live longer
?
You still managed to live life to the fullest for years
And then things got complicated
They found a donor so they operated
A gift and a curse, and concern that things took a turn for the worse
And even if I seen the signs I doubt the actions
Nothing had prepared me for what was 'bout to happen
The hospital; the 18th floor, vivid
July 18th, 2005 I can't forget it
It's that day I'll forever know
The end; the day I hope will never come

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end"
Hooked,Vanilla Ice,Rap,"1 2 3 4 Hit it, hit it

Yeah -- Here's a story 'bout my homeboy Randy
He was hooked on a girl named Candy
Started off as sex for fun
Now the girl's got him on the run.

Made love to her just one time
Now she runs his body and mind
He calls everyday on the phone
But Baby's playin' games
Leave a message at the tone
Soft and gentle is not her style
This girl is so damn wild.
All my partners wanna get next to her
But she ain't down with that
She moves right through 'em
Yeah, like paper plates
Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away.
If you had any guts today
You'd get your butt up and you'd walk away.
But you're hooked, Hooked
Know what I'm sayin', You're hooked, Hooked.

Yo, get tough was your new campaign
Cryin' over a girl, boy, you're insane.
She treats you like a dirty diaper
Use you one time and then she wipes you out
You understand what I'm sayin'?
If you're a man, you'll stop delaying and betraying
Try to act like you were mack
You can't go an hour without that sex attack.

What's wrong, boy, is it that good?
There's a lot of girls that ould and could
Take you, but you're so damn weak
I think you need to see professional help
For your problems
Lay on the couch and let the Dr. solve 'em
Talkin' to you and now he took your money
You're took on that honey, you're hooked
Hooked, Hooked

Fellas, you know what I'm sayin', He's hooked
Ain't got an ounce of mack in him, He's hooked.

Yeah, Baby, run you, she takes your money
While you'll kick back cryin' over honey
Now, I must admit she's fly
But I'll be damned if oh me oh my
If I ever let a girl run my thing
I'm poppin' it the most, You know what I'm sayin'?
So understand, you gotta be real hard
Don't treat her like a dog, But let her know.

You'll pull her card if she ever gets outta hand
What is you a boy or a man?
Stand up and tell BAby you ain't gonna be shook --
Yo punk, you're hooked on that sssy
I don't know why
I don't stand by and just let a girl, run over me
Fool -- I'm a man. Can't you see boy, You're hooked.

Yeah -- you're hooked, Might as well give her to me man
Let me do the wile thing, You're hooked
Shoot, I'm poppin' it man, You're hooked.

Let me talk to you for second. So, what's up, Vanilla?
Yo, man. Come here man. What?
You know, man, you ain't doin' it right. You're off man.

See, you know what the problem is?
That ring I bought her. The diamonds weren't big enough.
I'm tellin' ya' -- the diamonds weren't... I'm goin'...You know
What she wants... I'm goin' tell ya'...No man, when I first
Met her she said she wanted a 'Vette. I'm gonna' get her a
'Vette. No man, no... a 'Vette... I'm gonna get her the
'Vette. No man, hey, wait up.

Now it's Saturday, the day you hate most.
Why, because from coast to coast
You see girls everday in the club, Cold kickin' it
Reminds you of Baby when you used to be, with it
But now she took you one time for sex and you're so sprung
That the next time she seen you we knew she had to leave you.
Boy, you're hooked.

Boy, you're hooked, Hooked Hooked."

Straight after the sun goes down.
Gonin' out for all a dem haters I'm runnin' 'em down.
I'm bunnin' 'em down.
How you mean I'm gunnin' 'em down.
They goin' on as if they got the right to nyam up town.
Well no they won't we no more eatin' for dem now.

It's not the meat from a cow.
You wanna jack man and act like that's gonna be allowed?
D'you think I'd let that ride?
I'm too fucking proud.
The tables turn as I ride on you now.
Say goodnight as I'm puttin' your lights out.
Should've, taken me out when you had the chance,
Under the moonlight,
Time to meet the Devil and dance.
Ask Nas, you from the Hood
You have to get yourself a gun
And when it's on, you don't pop your shit and run.
You stand firm till the 'ole click's done
Or else you'll 'ave a slim chance of seeing tomorrow son.

So now I'm roaming with 2 straps,
Both off the safety catch,
Around the spots where they're shotting the crack.
I'm lookin' for cats, to get any haters I see.
How many hater's up in Finsbury are there out to get me?
Just like Chong,
A crack head paedophile an' his son.
Goin' on as if dey heavy 'cause they holdin' a gun
Dey can't run.
How many more life's ave gotta dun
So dem man's can sit back with a crack-pipe to bun?
Fuckin' scum,
Love to take life for fun
Killin' innocent sons and leaving heart broken mum's.
I say, MURDERER, blood is on your trainer,
P'liceman took that to forensic doctor.
MURDER the victim's fam'ly must all hate ya,
So kill me now because you won't kill me later.
I'm ready to die and I'm ready to take life
And I'm gonna be surprised if I make it through tonight.

If I make it till tomorrow, I'll be surprised (I'll be surprised), (I'll be surprised)
If I make it till tomorrow, I'll be surprised (I'll be surprised), (I'll be surprised)

All night I've been searching,
To find out where them fassy hoes are lurking.
Think I finally found them but I still gotta be certain.
I heard they shotting work in the crack house in the block,
The flat, without the curtain.
Can we go hurt them?
Firebomb the letter box and leave 'em all burnin'
If they coming runnin' a my bullets gonna splurt dem.
I'm all out to hurt dem and leave 'em for dead.
Makin' sure every one of dem gets one in the head.
I'm runnin' it red,
Not thinking 'bout runnin' from Feds
The only thoughts that I'm 'aving is to fill 'em full of lead.
I didn't wanna 'ave to go resort to all the bloodshed,
But now it's kill or be killed and left on your death bed.
As I look into the face of this crack-facing demon,
Knowing he's the type who rapes his own seaman.
What do you believe in,
The dark or the light?
I know I'm gonna be surprised if I make it throught tonight.

If I make it till tomorrow, I'll be surprised (I'll be surprised), (I'll be surprised)

Yes,Saigon,Rap,"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said, ?Yes?
?N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
?N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, ?Yes?

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' into her eyes
And when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said, ?Yes?
?N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
?N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, ?Yes?

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

She said, ?Yes?

Can't name 'em 'cause they shook
Took over some whip protect state

Secure a full view

You can't do it like me!

Now as the world turns, I let my blunt burn
Police writin' down my tags, like I'm con'cerned (fuck em)
I graduated from the nickels and dimes
You need the f.e.d.'s bitch, to come get mine
Get on the grind hoe, and stay the fuck up outta mine fo'

That ya shit don't stink? Faggot asses doin' the Sisqo thing in a thong
Y'all ain't never had a inkling of thinkin' of bringin' it on
Take my advice shorty
Before I make your life story the same shit R&B bitches sing in a song
'Cause when I ring the alarm the hooligans wanna fight for me
And bring the things that'll make a calm night stormy
Quite sorry if y'all didn't understand it
I'm at once demanded and underhanded
So when ya stash goes missin' from ya man's crib,
You'll be scratchin' your lid sayin', ""I betcha someone planned it""
Learn ya lesson
Don't take one for granted, whose confirmed profession is words as weapons
Observe discretion and freshman escape with they life
Use your street smarts, otherwise we takin' ya mics

You need street smarts for retards
Cause y'all ain't thugs y'all sweethearts
So ya better not come around these parts
Ya hear three barks and then see dark

It's best to know the ledge
Court jesters please observe, and heed the word of older heads
Before your life's scroll is read on the day of ya judgement
Pussy rappers cry when taken away from their husbands
Y'all sissies but ya have to try to feign a grown man's appetite
I wait for no man that's the life
When ya take what ya need before givin' ya up to speed
I'm like Nissan, but more driven
When it comes to sendin' sleepy rappers to the mortician
I'm like Kevorkian, ya all fit in
Cause my schedule is open ended like ya whore's kitten
Clitoris drippin' after two or more listens
I'm the porn magician,
Every deflowered chick's source of friction
Forced to fit in till the drawers are splittin
I'm the Puerto Bliccan, spittin' with the street smarts retards
Good riddance to the niggas on the R&B charts

Though they both live by different codes

Cause y'all wouldn't believe what I done did for the dough
I've walked the earth in the places where the niggas won't go
Workin' for racists, surrounded by the turbulent faces
And in search of oasis I found rap records
Earnin' the papers by whippin' halfsteppers
Don't get your GAP sweater tied in a bunch
Or think you're bad 'cause you're buyin' your lunch
By supplyin' the chunks for some guy on the junk
You need to try survivin' for once with a 9 to 5 for a month

And you need a way for gettin' 'em back?
You need to get street smarts for retards (I'm tellin' ya Duke)
You better get street smarts for retards (You better go tell ya whole crew)

Your out on the street corner sellin' drugs and such,

You need street smarts for retards (I'm tellin' ya Duke)
You better get street smarts for retards (You better run and tell ya whole crew)

If you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slammin' cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker

An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an OutKast? I know I am
As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else

Bombin' strategically to have one less adversary
And cops work the beat so my feet move with rhythm
On the ankle express to manifest youth and rebellion
Riskin' freedom to animate cities we live in
Using weapons from neckup and ambition like ammunition
Pushin' the envelope of graff higher for writers
As kings develop styles and inspire the birth of biters
Toys sketch on papyrus, then graduate to streets
Spawning new admirers and the cycle repeats and it goes...

4 for cops makin' your heart beat thump
Often that rush is enough to motivate us to bust

Or breakin the law if recognitions my accomplice?
I ponder while stompin' through concrete museums
Painting property consciously cause gangs are on surveillance
Indecent exposure is graffiti what it seems to be?
When bringing color to poverty stricken sceneries
Still a starving artist, 'cause I'd rather buy paint

(Vakill - Verse 1)

I breathe through the pain and exhale for, single parent homes
Exhale crack addict withdrawls they can't bear alone
Exhale smoke from the barrels of those bearin' chrome
Exhale for the slums where angels went there to roam
Wrote my first verse in a book of Tops
That rolled the weed that had the crooked cops tryna book my pops
He lived in a bottle, when he drank, I shook the spot
Wrote 3 16s for every time he took a shot
Took it as a sign of confirmation
When Will's brains was blown on the safe, couldn't find the combination
Minor confrontations no longer pugilistic
We resolved 'em with the hugest biscuits
Understand - I seen too much not to address it
Held the tools that you got you undressin'
And I would exhale jewels and spot you this blessin'
Now, take a deep breath, be honest with yourself, and exhale when I drop you this question -

(Hook - Repeat x 2)
When was the last time you breathed
Walked the streets without a vest and gat tucked in the sleeve
When was the last time you [exhale]
Without the assist of alcohol or twistin' up leaves

(Vakill - Verse 2)
This is season tickets to my pain, I invite you ingraduly
Show me a hero, and I'll, write you a tragedy
If there's bullet wounds, I'ma [??] right through it's cavity
Insightful and avidly up close and personal
I don't draw pictures - I texturize the paint
To touch souls of soldiers next to risin' rank
That's findin' it difficult to exercise restraint
'Cause when it comes to whips, women, and extra pies, we can't
Die broke, that's some of our fears
Every summer y'all hear shells drops
'Cause cats makin' sure they numbers are here
When there's a hood, there's a struggle
There with knuckles and gats, settle my several scuffles in an appropriate manner
And if Soviet hammers, won't hestitate
Patience is a virtue, that can six feet dirt you
And have your spirit leavin' Earth, and what's even worse?
A lot stop breathin' before they mastered breathin' first

(Vakill - Verse 3)
It goes one for Ken's kite, two for twin light-skinned dykes
Three for T-Max with white pinstripes
Wish I could send 'em, Lord knows what your life's been like
Five years in the beast with no ray of light in sight
But I'ma ride till the Good Lord put it in neutral
Keep extra clips fuller than usual
Cocksuckas that wanna pull it and shoot you
I'ma put a bullet in mutual, Channel 32 Fox bulletin news you
Speak to Marilyn Manson, crack is viable
Where atheists and Baptists rival
Home of evangelists and black disciples
And two-time felons that's quick to carjack you with an ROTC practice rifle
Change the game, same rules to ref use
So F you, I refuse to leave until the impact I left's huge
This here's a redneck incestuous flow - son of your nephews

Meet The G That Killed Me,Public Enemy,Rap,"Man to man
I don't know if they can
From what I know
The parts don't fit
(Ah shit)
How he's sharin' a needle
With a drug addict
He don't believe he has it
(Either)
But now he does, he doesn't know 'cause he
Goes straight to a ho
Tell you what who was next on the but
Wild thinin' on a germ
Runnin' wild
Yo stop
But the bag popped"
Mad Wunz,Masta Ace Incorporated,Rap,"I got the mad wunz [x3]
You know I got the mad wunz
I got the mad wunz [x3]
You know I got the mad wunz

(Chorus: Lord Digga)

That's right y'all, clap your hands y'all
Cheeba cheeba y'all, to the beat y'all
That's right y'all, clap your hands y'all
Cheeba cheeba y'all, to the beat y'all

(Repeat)

(Verse One: Ase)

Bust it, straight out the plaque like a smoke from a stack
It's the Masta Ase honey better chill and catch a smack
To the left check (uh) if you speak freak watch your mouth
'Cause I'm gettin' play all the way down South
And I got the dope, new, off...
...Beat style, and you got beef well make stew
You hold the bowl and I'll do the pourin
Rhymes are abundant like shells on the shore and
Three little pigs made a song out of sand
The Big Bad Ase'll blow them rhymes down man
'Cause yo I'm not a sailor and my name is not Barnacle Bill
But I run game like a carnival
Don't try to flex or you'll fall like September
Still got a posse just add another member
Lord D (the D stand for Digga
Rollin' Wit Umdada Masta Ase is my nigga)
Punks better slow down and check the speed limit
Get too much light and I'ma dim it
So yo bust the flex and turn in your text
To chapter four, and let me break down the law
I stay away from sluts got respect for my dick
And St. Ides'll probably kill my ass just as quick
Original the style and, rhymes in a pill and
How many brothers do I know on Rikers Island?
One two three four five I'm losing count
But no matter what the sum it's too big of an amount

I got the mad wunz
(Kick it)

Verse Two:

You sound fresh but I'm fresher
Yessir you'll get torn and, worn in, contents under pressure
I got Magic in my Johnson like potion
Try to play me Ashe you'll get rubbed like lotion
Must to blow your trouble with the C-cypher power
In Cali they call 'em one time they be gafflin every hour
Which means they be knockin', goodfellas say a pinch
The skins are too tight, baby doll I got the wrench
I like the lowriders with the Daytons nice and shiny
If you in the West you got the best you get the heiny
On the other hand uptown at the Apollo
Chromed out with no tints and hammers make 'em follow
But I never get, I say I never get too caught up
Because I know easy come easy go
Nuff respect to the women with the job skills
Not trying to find them, a man to pay the bills
'Cause I'm not the one to play piggyback
So take the crack between your legs and find another attack
And just that, mentality alone
Keeps me a healthy happy home, the mad wunz

I got the mad wunz
You know I got the mad wunz
I got the mad wunz
Check it

Verse Three:

Bloodifier, I'm higher, kid you better retire
I'm hot like clothes in the dryer
I got skills that you can't comprehend
I got beats that never come to an end
Yeah, I rock like your grandmother's chair, it's rare
Peace to graffiti writers everywhere
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
If I gave 'em to my posse, they'd probably drink 'em all
But I don't want a murder, and I never heard of your
Wack ass, so save the Flack for Roberta
And leave on the midnight train the midnight to Georgia
Because I floored ya [just kick it]
You probably didn't know but I inflict a lot of pain
Don't sleep or you'll be having Nightmares like Dana Dane
I don't mean to be precocious but uh
I'm stompin on MC's with my boots like roaches
Hey mate, the PlayMate of the month's not the one
That I pursue, though on low she would get done
I got the wunz that are crazy type mad
The bass'll make you sick and make your ears go bad
So come and get it, come and get it one time
Before I have to say another rhyme on the mad wunz

I got the mad wunz
You know I got the mad wunz
I got the mad wunz
And I'm Casper..."
Take My Chances,Opio,Rap,"(Opio)
Yeah... take my chances

(Chorus: Opio)
I think I'll take my chances
And roll the dice, roll the dice, before tonight
I think I'll take my chances
And roll the dice, roll the dice, control my life
I think I'll take my chances
And roll the dice, roll the dice, I'm so precise
I think I'll take my chances
And roll the dice, roll the dice, I'm cold as ice

(Opio)
My uncle spoke to me, said you're still a young man
Don't get stuck with your dick in the sand, stick to your plans
Fuckin' with my syndicate, went to Japan
Touch mics like a chingy chick, then you get slammed
In Repungee, speak in different tongues, but we still understand
That I'm sick, make 'em flip in the stands
Could be a drug what it's feelin' like, the energy man
Can't get enough of this shit, got the spike and rubber bands
It's a muh'fucker in this life, I'm right I'm bubblin
It's right from the begin, the light comes from within
Trust my instincts, not the government
Try to get me with the nightsticks, cuff me and give me 10
To 15, I'm emceeing steer clear of felonies
Ride with this melody, you will remember me
Though +Arrested+ my +Development+ I'm not from 'Tennessee'
Infinity, we can achieve, yes indeed

(Opio)
Sharin my gift, a paradigm shift
'Cause it's good for you baby like asparagus tips
Bear witness to perilous pitfalls of strip malls
Devoid of culture, I advance like a soldier
Eyes in the back of my head, past present future
Alive in the secular realm, but just passin through it
Undefeated by coercion and deceit
Or the murder in the street, I just firmly plant my feet
In the dirt man my soil while they thirst for the spoils
Then and now it's all about chaos and turmoil
As the wizard burn sage, I see the information age
Mislead, sendin visionary minds astray
In search of the crystal ball against the laws of nature
Confined to prison walls of your own creation
They over on the wrong side of adjacent
I don't fear death or the unknown, shake 'em

(Instrumental to end)"
Still In Love,Rakim,Rap,"Hey yo every time hear some real hip hop man I start thinking... yo I""m still in love man ...listen
I'm in booth like prison
Lid like lift
If music's like woman
I'm whipped like a nymph
I love to keep it pushing
Like the basement speakers
Love hearing real hip hop and making heaters
Born entertainer
Armed with the flamer
If they bust shoots with it
Come on it's the blamer
Got the place to lose it
Booth shaking to it
True gangster music
Screwface included
Macho lingo
The beat'll remind you
Of the quatro cinco
Or cinco de mayo
Put it in your car
Turn the sound sky high
Ra down the block sound like a drive by
Keep chicks moving
Heat keep them open
Put 'em in the mood and they leave something broken
D.J set the scene to it in the club
Sound track to the hood theme music for the thug
I told you I'm still in love baby
Beats drop heavy every rhyme one ton
Streets not ready hurry nine one one
Spot gets frantic
Too late to panic
The meteor they can't stop from hitting the planet
Sodom and Gamorah
Sadam and Osama
The horror without the bomb and no llama
Spitting at a show performing
Vocals are swarming
Flow overflowing like it's global warming
I flood the market out
I'm over your head now
Roll the carpet out

The droughts over and dead now
When I kill a track
The true story the cause of euphoria
The thrillers back
Next flow level
Hip hop lover
Dress code ghetto
Lit vibe cutter
Just an artist trying to rep the hardest
And make history so not even death can part us
It's love
I'm still in love baby I'm still in love
It's the god Rakim
They know I get it (in)
They pull me back (in)
I'm going back (in)
Spitting fire
Ghetto music
Getting higher like a drug therapeutic
Hooked like an addict
Strung like sex
Look I got to have it
It alleviates stress
Quick as marijuana settle in the brain
Needle hit the record like heroin to vein
Blood start flowing
Adrenaline rush
Love start jonesing
School yard crush
Ra still feining still emceeing
More deals and geeing
Broads still screaming
It's that dude here's that sick
Spit that jewel
Talk that (shhh)
And wait till the lights go off the show start
That's when it's time for Ra to go hard
I told you I'm still in love

They don't really care about this music
They don't even know how to use this
I said they don't really care about this music
They don't even know how to use it
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up

They usin' this to advertise, enable savage lies
They always play the role, better stratagize
Do you really believe or only criticize?
You phonies this disguise never fooled me
I wear no jewelry, I play it cool see
Don't follow rules he said
To a dame he wasn't in, he was never my friend
He wasn't down when
I used to sleep on floors, and I only knew my pen
I grew within and spread throughout
Listen my routes mission
Is about liftin myself and about kids and
Disposition you might take with ur bitchin
But if I didn't bitch, they might never listen to this
And wonder is that about me
Well now really what you about
Progression and makin' money
Profession yeah that's funny
We do it in the streets for fun
Since I was young, hip hop made adrenaline run
And I was dumb, to think it was the same for all
But now that I know, I got alot of blame for y'all

Fuck people in positions of power who trip with their power
Probably wont what you got to, plus more soul they are sour
It's been happening forever and a day but now's the final hour
Ur not the smartest ones, they got the largest guns
We will crumble your tower
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep (we will)
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up

Well now the people who run this biz don't know the culture
And the people who run this biz are a bunch of vultures
I'm a bull
But I define gravity, you don't wanna get sad with me
What a travesty
Your majesties a fake
To laugh with me is to relate. I chuck at the fickle fucks till they fuck me up
For years I wait
So many peers I reach but I stay limited
And then we lit candle in the wind growin' timid with it
Why am I so hard to satisfy?
And anyone who I think can is always mad they try
Any other lads who are fly, they fly by
Just below the radar, but I'm glad they made it far
I had to play my part no body else could
Lookin' back on all the strugglin but that's what really felt good
And that's crazy but I'm not, that's a used up trait
What I got is a devine fate
My mind state fluctuates
And I'm up late
Fuck hate I got love in the face of that 'cause I learned through rap
I never burn you back I just vent
Even after all of my last efforts have been spent I give 100%
And wonder who sent you or I to be the true speaker and freak it till they die

Fuck people in positions of power who trip with their power
Probably wont what you got to, plus more soul they are sour
It's been happening forever and a day but now's the final hour
Ur not the smartest ones, they got the largest guns
We will crumble your tower
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep (we will)
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up

They don't really care about this music
They don't even know how to use this
I said they don't really care about this music
They don't even know how to use it
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep

It's Alright,MIMS,Rap,"It's all right
Whoa, let me tell you now

I came to blow a grip
You know I don't care
Grab a couple stacks
Throw the money in the air
Drive the black car
Open up the bar
Shut the club down
Leave with a couple broads
You're f***ing with a star
You can see the glow
I'm pushing 40 stacks for a 10 minute show
Nigga do the math
I'ma need a bath
'Cause I'm filthy rich
Making money out the ass
My little cousin told me this is my year
I won't stop till a nigga shuttin down Times Square
Yeah, I do this for the block no lies
So I can drop the top on the 645
See until you're on top niggas don't show respect
But my name MIMS aka Cut The Check
I used to play the bench
But now I'm on deck
When I'm hopping off the jet
Nigga's face look upset
But I'm quick to tell them...

It's all right
Whoa.
I'm so quick to tell them
It's all right
Whoa.

Now you know the shit popping when the chick you just met
Got your name tattooed on her ass and her neck


All the ladies love me
I'm their favorite MC
Nigga true definition P.I.M.P.
There ain't a place I ain't seen
E' ry strip, e' ry scene
Like my nigga B.I.G said
""It was all a dream!""
Now I'm sitting in the Beam
Inside money green
Nigga all about the cash
You can tell how I lean
Keep your eyes on the Beam
Like I told you in the Hot song
It's all about the cake,
Being broke ain't a option
Haters in the hood with the heat tryin' to pop strong
I'm'a quick grip when they see me with the rock song
But nigga I'm MIMs AKA Cut The Check
See I keep it so hot but I never bust a sweat
I used to play the bench
But now I'm on deck
When I'm hopping off the jet
Nigga's face look upset
But I'm quick to tell them...

I'm the freshest motherfucker on the scene
A grand on the jeans
Sittin' on some ice creams
I represent New York
Big city of dreams
Where we ride on 10's
But you know we keep it clean
See I lay my game down
Flip a few styles
10 times out of 10
You gon' like the way it sounds
You know I get it in
And if you don't like it it's fine
So get yours
'Cause I'm'a definitely get mine"
Batting Practice,Souls Of Mischief,Rap,"(A-Plus)
Move over bacon, 'cause the swine is out the picture
Switch the mixture, fix your eyes on the Mister
Twisting necks, fixing bets when I'm cheating
Getting many skins 'cause I been down with Ian (?)
Ever since the clever hits I heard ever (y) word
I used a Louisville Slugger for a sucker
Duck a, little bit faster than the last men
That have been up to Astor Ave., and then
Asking 'bout the Souls of Mischief, beat 'em into the soil
I'm cooking up your brain, feel the pain (until it boils...)
Over the ????, you ain't got one to piss in yet
If you've got a question, and it's ""Am I dissing?"" -- Yep
I can energize if you're -ready like Ever was
I'm ready as I ever will be, so chill, G
Will the filthy dirty rotten scoundrel step
If he does, then we can beat him to the ground and jet
Most say, I'm the nicest person you'll ever meet
Then fools step, but they slept on my clever treat
One handy bat that's made of light steel
Break a bone or two, and they just might heal back
I want to get a little piece like Reese's
But brothers are mad, because Ad (am) is the feces
So A-Plus may just play Willie Mays
And you better get wise, until Met really pays

It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I've got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a
It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a

(Tajai)
There's a crew (?) ???? on my shoulder, can I kill it?
How can I maintain pain, blame a pan or skillet
That's swung on the misty streets, all in a night's work
Flights worn by you can keep my feet warm too
Ooh, you know _I Gots to Laugh_ like Cas (ual) did
Bad kids are blinking, like ""Curses! I'm worsted!""
Your spidy-sense may tingle
But my swing fills your head with cowbebs, so wake up, sleeper
Slimly constituted yet I boot it and bruise some
And flights just might get a tad bit gruesome
Who's dumb enough to get stuck with the pitchfork?
Rich give me name-brands and main man's call me Mork
'Cause I've got Mindy, to remove your Fendi


Why call the cops, I sacks (sax) them hoes like Ken (ny) G.
Silhouette's seen, and the next thing's blackness
Attire robbery, or a kick from my Patricks
Hat tricks, with my hockey stick, or a hole in one
With a golf club and the soft love to run
A gun ruins fun like parents, and a hot one
Got one kid like me stepping, 'cause a weapon
Should be club-like, but them thugs like to blast
No sweatin', and Tajai can jets in (Jetson) like Astro
Ask no questions, lessen your cash flow
Fast though (?) the task (?) grows greater, later...

(Opio)
Opio is no Pinocchio, I never fib, kid
Dib on your belongings when I'm longing for a new fit
I am quite cunning, never _Running Man_
And I stand with a bat in hand, pants firmly planted in the sand
Step to this, you'll sort of get swung on like a tire swing
Or batted like Babe Ruth, lose a tooth
If you try to bring anger to the wrangler
You'll get strangled if you tangle with the terrible
Bid farewell to jewelery, the same goes for cash flows
Snatch those, catch those greenbacks
Swing bats to dingbats I bring backs to knapsacks
Reggie Jacks (on) can't match the switch-hitter, get a fit or two
Split a few lips when I flips a pitch like Cy Young, die young
Never ever try (?) one, soul is one that's mischievous
I'll twist your wrist so wisen (?) up (?)
Did you disrespect a father figure, took (?) your Rolex
So heads (?) and solar plexus compressed as I flex
Thugs hug my slugs brung from the Phillip Louis
Through the, joint to the point of pressure and then smoothly
Slipped off your valuables, you're mad I pulled another heist
Smothered twice, thrice, I thrash men and mice
My soul lies in my bat, I am one with my Easton
Once I grip the handle, the vandal is released and
Visions of viciousness are carried out with tactics,
Slapsticks, but never comedy, it's _Batting Practice_

Aw shit! Hieroglyphics be tearing up shit!
Hieroglyphics be tearing up shit! (4x)"
Who? (Got My Back),Big Shug,Rap,"Uh uh, uh uh
Where the real niggaz at?
What, who got my back?

And who will be ready for war at all cost?
Position themselves to take the fake heads off?
And who will really cock their weapon? not their mouth
When it's time for you and your team to go all out
And who in the face of danger keeps quiet?
Never snitch, never give up your man's and them for shit
And who will rock my product like 'caine?
Push that shit like rocks to the top of the game
Is it you? And who got my back like a cape?
So I can be a super hero,
Get more money like dinero (Deniro?).
And who will never sell their soul or the asshole for the dollar?
If you feelin' me niggaz, then holla.
And who sees this shit through veteran eyes,
And for hip-hop be more than ready to die?
Surprised it's not many real niggaz left.
My mind's designed to get, while you step and fetch

And who gonna get my back, oh
And who gonna bust their gat, for me
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

And who's gonna support their seeds?
Be a father to their child,
And still live big willy style?
And who gonna walk their dogs till their tongues hang out?
Till world wide, your joints bang out?
And who's gonna keep the faith in their niggaz?
Not get gassed and caught up with the silly gold diggers?
And who will never hate, never be an ingrate,
Never whine or cry, whether free or upstate?
And who on steroids, all muscled up
Won't rub us the wrong way and get their ass fucked up?
And who will write their own rhyme
Time after time?
Hot shit that leaves the comp dumb and blind
If it's you than you came to the right place,
And if it's not you, then you get smashed with a brick in the face.

And who gonna get my back, who
And who gonna bust their gat, who
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

And gonna get my back, Who
And gonna bust their gat, who
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

And who gonna get my back, who
And gonna busts their gat, who
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

Who got me, who

Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport
'N told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for ??
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself a cut above
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother ??
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck is all that's glistenin'
Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined
I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt
Y'all matter less every time this margarita tilt

I could go number one ten times

Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear
Get some show money from UGLY and buy a keg of beer
And another pig to give my other pigs some company
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary
In due time, but there's business left to attend to
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another tractor for my great aunt Missy
Yeah, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy
Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hick hop

I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny

I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be
An uncanny wit plus a timing that's impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable
Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds

I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine

Encouraging my neighbors to be rude
Unable to chew food

Waterloo, what who?
From ABBA to shabba, hip hop, grime to ragga
I blabber the weird grammar due to listening to hits like a hammer
Bang bang, everybody turn this up

Bang bang bang oiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Whinging and whining 'cause I'm here vibing
Bang bang bang oiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Whinging and whining 'cause I'm here vibing

Allow country and western
I got a suggestion
The music in question is here caving your chest in
And I ain't got time for resting
I'm never snoring
Interesting, my living room noises are never boring
Grannies wanna kick my door in
We're constantly warring till one in the mornin'
Now lights off, lights on, I'm teasin' them
They think I've gone to sleep but I change the CD again
Now don't go on like you don't like it
You're only moaning 'cause your records are shit
And they skip, now just zip your lip

Regular Girl,Kool Keith,Rap,"Butt naked! Girls walk sunset with they ass out
I start cadillacs with suits, wear my mask out
With brims tilted, I finger pop the whole block
Make freaks wear wigs, and put the rubbers on my cock
You see me out there, with big balls like Rosie Grier
Players cream, I pull panties out your wet dreams
Get deep in cracks, and wash 'em out like Mr. Clean
Bring your Massengil, the public think I'm very ill
Like Jimmy Z, posin' naked for the FCC
I'm not no basketball star, your girl watch me pee
Clock me like cops, every time my sperm drops
She's in my face with thongs, chewin' lollipops
I'll hit that butt on the low, just like Monica
Play three tunes and let her blow on my harmonica
I'm out here, you rollin' fake in Union Square
I'll make you go blonde, brunettes runnin' down they hair

Regular girl, is so boring (get out my face)
Regular girl, you never turn me on (work the latex)

You saw my porno flick, nutsacks banged up on your TV
Your girl pulled her panties off real quick, tryin' to see me
She wants an autograph, a part with my anal staff
You scream test for AIDS, stretch marks make me laugh
Sign your contracts for Willie, smoke a big Philly
I'm too old for young girls, gigglin actin' silly
I'm sugar daddy, your aunt gon' be worried duke
Your mom's at my hotel, her bra is real cute
Dressed in g-strings, she's scopin' me, eatin fruit
She licked my balls, I came like Niagara Falls
Brought her tittes to prince show instead of Lou Rawls
Her pelvis grind, she smile show me pantylines
I'll smack that butt, the pro spank at different times
Like Max Steiner Hardcore ? its on the dirty floor
Make you scream for stiff rods, you don't want no more
Penetration, I don't do that on your menustration
I want movies back, you smile, addin' lubrication
You know your stilo, orgies doin' three people
Kodak action, Black Tail, butt satisfaction
You lookin' good sweet cheeks...

I turned the Lakers off, you can't stop my afterparty
A fifth of vodka, and latex, drink your Bacardi
I serve it well through tubes and watch your rectum swell
Service your clits with steel, machines keep it real
Got that ramrod, that's pumpin' through your back hard
You be seein cum stains on Sunset Boulevard
My rubber send streaks and heels off your girls feets
You not psychedelic wimp, I'm still your girls pimp
That's part interest, magnificent, mind power
I got nuts that clean kill, let me take my shower
Wash off my pubic, and let the females do my nails
Watch naked legs in chairs and enter soft tails
Wear stocking caps with maps and shoft for soft cracks
Lift off your hairpeace, while milk squirts up on your weave
You know my skin needs butter, your cheeks are popcorn
I get deep, go run in butt like the unicorn
Rodeo anus banger, quick with the middle finger
Her tampons drop down between her maxi
I left tips for cocked up legs in the taxi
Yo take her home cab driver, here's her panties"

(Alias LL Cool J)
(He's bad...)

No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop,
Make you say, ""Go LL and do the wop""

If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet
'Cause I ain't met a muthafucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good
I got a gold name plate that says I wish you would

And when rap begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over you know I'm a win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!

Sparring competition that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock I think my phone here is tapped

I'm bad

I'm like Tyson icin' I'm a soldier at war
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes been rappin' for ten years and
Even when I'm braggin' I'm bein' sincere

MC's can't win I make 'em rust like tin
They call me Jaws my hat is like a shark's fin
Because I'm bad as can be got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed

I couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one

And can happen on time never standin' on lime
You wanna try me first you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean

I'm bad

I eliminate punks cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame
I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane

I'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make the sea's twist at high tide

Never retire or put my mike on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad

MC's they retreat 'cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em
I'm the best takin' out all rookies
So forget Oreos eat Cool J coookies

I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye
Sparrin' MC's and I'm a never get whipped
When I retire I'll get worshiped like an old battleship

L.L. I'm bad other rappers know
When I enter the center they say, ""Yo, yo there he go!""
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a rap cool large

The original Todd teachin' how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Atilla the Hun but no I'm Threwler his son

My vocals exact like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grab-bag
No good scavenger catfish vulture
My tongue's a chisel and this compositions sculptured

Yeah, and I bet you got laid back
Yeah, ima uh, I'm a just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man, don't sweat it, yo, we gonna catch some stuff, dude
Oh no, I'm kinda tired
Nah, we got a basket, were gonna fill this basket before we go, yo
Aight, bro
Cause there are otha fish...

(Slim kid tre)
It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talkin'
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalkin
This slimmy caught me peepin, this means she wasn't sleepin'
On who I was, so she crept in like a hawk
In a minutes time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note cause of the way that she was walkin'
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought wed be forever
Didn't have an um-ber-ella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never sympin, and leave your love life limp
Therell be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's otha fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is

(In the sea) you know there's otha fish in the sea that is

I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be olive oyls number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind sometimes its more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den b
Macho, but I hancho like pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper, are they fakin or for real?
What's the deal dabbers? will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch lickin' drip drip from a niggaz benefits
He doesn't even suit ya and hes surely not ya size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up ya eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That ya don't bruise a limb, as ya swim with otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is

Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbin up?
My hand has been extended every since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, cause ya thought you'd catch a cupid
And you found that love ain't two wiffs of shit
So I resign or quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussywhip, elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
Id charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they steppin with my lady
They workin on a baby, I'm pushin up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me big gibraltor miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like on to otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is

You know there's otha, you know that there's otha
(Chorus repeats 20x)

In the sea, baby (4x)"
Six Million Ways,Emanon,Rap,"Just a kid only 13 with somethin'
Havin' acceptance in this world is too much
The changes, the pain is fun for some
It's too much gold, regressed with some shit
The struggle ...
Three years in my hand for the juggle
Time to break away and pop out the bubble
Trouble in the form of family life it cuts like a knife, band aids was drugs and sluts
19 and now it seems like it's too much and the glue stuck the fucks that I don't have and it sucks
I've been taught to measure my life by the bill
Broken drug addict and my life's just steel
Frustrated to the point when I might just kill myself
Tonight's the night, fuck might I will!
In the form of pill, too bloody with the gun cause there's six million ways to die ... choose one.

Choose one, Choose one
The mystery of death so we all gotta die

I haven't had a girlfriend in a long time
Now I do and everything is real fine
Like this girl who I claimed was all mine
And she was from head to toe to behind

We was in love
She was my dove
I wasn't dumb
Everytime I thought until I seen some shit that made me think I need a gun, but I just really need to run
A silly dumb plus bum choked up my chest nah
Oh shit, DUMB! Girl plus dude that she fucked just for fun
FUCK FUCK FUCK silly bitches on the run cause there's six million ways to die ... choose one.

Choose one, Choose one
The mystery of death is that we all gotta die, but BEFORE I GO!

I knew this dude who was dope on the mix
Who analized how the legends used dope for a fix
He bugged, on the drugs by the mic givin' him pricks
Said, Don't do it just, Hit this shit
It's already a hit, don't trip
He took a trip with some heads so now he's used to it
Shot it up in his wrists, now he's hooked to it
Sat up one night and wrote a whole song book to it
I came over later to look through it
Look and found needles and spoons
And as I read left and right I took his shit
Stood him up, threw him down, Now get off that shit!
He just stared at me dumb with a tear in his eye then took off to run
I'ma quit just one more fix then I'm done! Cause there's six million ways to die ... Choose one

Choose one, Choose one, Choose one, Choose one
The mystery ... It's DEATH! So we all, we all gotta die!"
Head Bobs,Black Eyed Peas,Rap,"I'm hard to handle like bikes with no bars
We excite stores that got dykes leaving doors
Unlock the heated 'cause they know we're not well
Left them breathless now they're waiting to exhale
Waiting to exhale with some competition
So come in and text well
The next one gets hung and chip of a chisel
I'm making chicks' nipples sizzle
There's no question to the way I rip the riddle
I'm awesome, I bring on monsoon when I bloom and blossom
And run over niggas like opossums
Froze on the road with my bike on they cornea
Man I'm warning you, look, the black eyed peas is formin up
Ring around your throat that's made up of razor blades
Put the slice and let nice and easy humble days
On out, over, well known casanova
Can I put on an army, quick to take it over
9 on my niggas, count all my figures
Money on the street went entertainment
Nowadays brothers are getting paid doing nothing
Reciting the same line with the lame rhymes
Frontin rappers actin' like their pops' was orville redenbacher
They quick to go pop

Yo, I got the corn beef
I got the moz
I got the shotty
Ay yo, I got the buck shot

Ay yo, I got the burgers
I got the grill
If you're steppin' up next
Ya better flex that skill

The House Of Pain is in full effect
Everybody in the place give full respect
If your girl's in the house keep the ho' in check
And if I'm bustin' off caps, you better hit the deck

Steppin' on stage with the fly routines
I'm hemmin' up suckers like bell bottom jeans
I always switch trains in Jamaica, Queens
When I go to by the street to see my Aunt Ilene

Danny Boy's comin' with the Irish style
The money back guarantee, I make it worth your while
I'm layin' out fools like kitchen tile
You come around with a frown, and ya leave in a pile

Step back man, I ain't a black man
But every time I grab the mike I rock a phat jam
Without the Slimfast, and if I skim past
You know I step up and get a ho' with gym blast

I give her what she wants, even if she fronts
The Hill is down with the House, they got the philly blunts
Ya know we roll 'em up, and then we light 'em up
And then we puff them up and pass them so Danny Boy blasts 'em

I got the shell-toe Adidas, with the fat strings
The Celtic crosses and the Claddagh rings
The straight edges razor and the marther pump
You heard me shit clickin', now it's time to jump

Jump around just like a frog on a log
Fuck the Dukes because I like Boss Hogg
I'm hittin' home runs like my man Wade Boggs
And if you try to act stupid, I'm droppin' the dogs

Every time I go to town
People start kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if my dog's a hound
You better stop kickin' my dog around

Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit

Now I've droppin' records since the age of seventeen
First I came solo, but I now I got a team
It's the four man crew, with the Irish stew
You catch us puffin' on a blunt, and sippin' a brew

What's up with that brew, man, hurry up and finish
Now grab the bar maid and order me another Guinness
You can drink the Guinness while I'm sippin' on the mickeys
When it comes to hookers, yo, the Everlast is picky

Always got my hat in case I come across a quicky
And when I do my shows I get the hoes all hot and sticky

The House Of Pain is in full effect, yeah
I say the House Of Pain is in full effect
You know the House Of Pain is in full effect, yeah
And anyone who steps up is gettin' wrecked

Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit

Ol' Evil Eye,Insane Clown Posse,Rap,"""Start tha movie.""

""I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me
Insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes, it was this. One
Of his eyes resembled that of a vulture. A pale, blue eye with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold. And so, by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever.""

So I'm headed door to door
With my grandmother's cookie jar.
I'm sellin' cookies, 12 for a dollar.
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any.
I resort to goin' cheaper - 2 for a penny.
Anybody, everybody, they hate me.
I can tell when they spit and degrade me.
There's only one house left, the last on the block.
Old Man Willie on the hilltop.
I ring the doorbel, the door creeps open.
And there it was starin' and scopin'.
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin'
I was trippin'. ""Ah, seeya!""
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking
About his eyeball winking and blinking.
And it looked not a damn thing like the other. Ugh!
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker.
It hypnotized me, mesmorized me.
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me.
Creepers, where'd you get that ball?
And tell me how it even fits in your skull.

I want a big long knife to stick it in.
I wanna lift up the eyelid and kick it in.
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard.
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye!
(End prechorus)

Evil eye...
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! Die-die-die-die-die-die-die)
Evil eye...
Oh-Oh
(End chorus)

""Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you
Should've seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with
Caution with
What
Foresight, with what patience I went to work. I was never kinder to the
Old man
Than
During the whole week before I killed him.""

A day gone pass since I heard about J.O.
Met up in this sleigh, 'cause I don't fuckin' play.
Anyway, I gotta do him in. Got a rusty revolver
Put the silver bullets in.
I'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget.
Down my drawers with the bucket.
It's time to go, fuck it.
I stuck it up... to his neck when he came to the door.
I really didn't know what I was in for.
First the cold man stared, no a gaze, no a stare.
Kinda like there was no one there.
How weird, my body froze with the blink of his eye.
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine.
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break.
I gotta try to make... my way to the gate.
Wait. I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground.
W-What the fuck was that? I think I heard a sound,
Turned around, there it was, starin' at my face.
This little old man's eye's a make me a mental case.
That's when I felt the pain deep inside,
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide.

And aquot;That night it ceased. The old man was dead. I placed my hands on the
Heart and there for many minutes there was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye
Will trouble me no longer. His eye will trouble me no longer."""
Claimin' True,OutKast,Rap,"(Big Boi)
Well it is I, the pimp playin' nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hoe sellers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claimin true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothin' wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dippin and dodgin bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady tryin' to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eatin watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now, to big felon

Chorus: repeat 2X

I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggaz step up like the playas that's in back of me

(Dre)
All heavenly Father, why do you even bother watchin over me
Growin' up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like comin' harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you fly when niggaz flee
If it is one of my own, I'm lettin the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when I'm slangin quarter keys
Just tryin' to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be workin niggaz butt naked
At Magic City, shakin titties just to pay the rent
Lord, tryin' to hustle must be somethin' that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinkin'
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on dankin
'Cause I be takin' the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you drainin like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little botty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

Chorus: repeat 4X"
In a Dream,Kero One,Rap,"I'm wanderin free... just living in a dream...
Every day that goes by... is the same old thing

I push myself out of bed and wrestle with the clock
Every day this battle's fought, snooze buttons a flop
But today I win the struggle, with time to cuddle
Embrace my girl to keep my mind outta trouble
Hear the bubble of the bong envelope the smoke
Clear the bowl take a toke leaving me in a choke
?Ring? you're a joke! all in my ear through the phone
That's my OTHER girl, the one that hates when I'm stoned
So I'm torn but I know where my heart is
But the temptress's so inventive when I spark it
Seducin me with her words in different ways I never heard
The pipe or the girl... which one do I prefer?
Thinking too much, I need to get my ass to school
Always late to class in fact barely getting through
Grades are slippin, minds flippin on me
Thinking crazy thoughts man it's like a dream

I'm wanderin free... just living in a dream...
Every day that goes by... is the same old thing

So now I'm on the shame train bus 23
Thinkin' bout friends, foes and family
Like how my best friend was family to me
Till making friends with the foe to become my enemy
But see, times weren't always ugly like that
From first girl kiss to thrown fist he had my back
Until his train of thought got derailed off track
By that rock known as crack placed in his path
But how could I tell? he played it off real well
Smooth talker with the ladies who made his stories gel
In and out of jail with babies on the way

Kicked out of his crib, so with me I let him stay
Loaning him cash for rainy days and entertainment
But at that rate, sun rays came like his payments
In fact, his payback robbing the crib like R. Kelly
Money taken from me, like he was not guilty
And never found exit only his next hit
His will power had biceps but couldn't flex it
Now he's in prison forgiven I won't forget
Our youth and how surreal this life can get...

I'm wanderin free... just living in a dream...
Every day that goes by... is the same old thing

Yo my exit's here, I hit the bell for the bus stop
Still in a zone, herb does that when you must talk
My girls waiting, arms folded with that look
The look that makes me want to go to sleep or read text books
Man what do I tell her, I know who I'd choose
But before my lips could move, she leaves me confused
Off in the distance, she's shrinking from view
But I guess that's the truth on this path I pursue
Where focus is gone, smoking every night
Choking from bongs, blunts, pipes, and this life
I need to make things right I wanna feel what's real
Cause livin' in a dream got my purpose concealed
So I gaze at my classmates, running with backpacks
Rushing like they cared so much what if I had that?
I ask that as I pick up me feet
Showered by sunrays but wandering free
And blend into the scene where things ain't what they seem
Into a scene where things ain't what they seem
Searching for a moment of clarity?
It's like I'm living in a dream."

Ka Sera Sera,Funkdoobiest,Rap,"We used to go to school with this girl
She wore the fat truck earings and the diamonds and pearls
Angel on the catfish straight ""A"" scholarship
Smart career, had it all, all brains and I'll admit
With the face of a goddess, packed a real boddess
I mean nobody was the hottest
Around the way fine she was looking real decent
Graduated soon, I ain't seen her recent
Till one night I rolled out pretty far
She was shaking her ass and getting loud at the bar
90 pounds heavy with the rolls on her belly
And her underarms smelly
What happened to my class queen?
I mean her breath was stinking, fought off with the apple sheen
Speed freak in a g-string dancing
Teasing me, plus telling me I'm handsome
Looked like she had enough to keep herself up
That's what they told me 'cause I had swelter

Que Sera Sera was meant to be, it's gonna be
Que Sera Sera was meant to be, it's gonna be

We used to run around town in static cane
My crew was automatically down, drinking
Hanging with the fellas on the corner
If full pulled up replied you're a gonner
Pay backs a bitch and you best watch your back
I laughed in his face he was grazed off tracks
He rolled out angry, homie look alert
Fuck that we don't need no one hurt
Off the trouble nine scents of manic deprescent
Crack that adolescent tell one doubt not
I heard her shout bang out, right on the corner
Where all my homies hang out
He killed the boy all unexpected
Now he thinks his hood should respect him
No one should die cause of me
I scalped your bitch and ruptured her spline
Me and my crew know where he stay at
Fools been warned so here's your pay back

Que Sera Sera was meant to be, it's gonna be
Que Sera Sera was meant to be, it's gonna be"
Twelve Sided Dice,Dream Warriors,Rap,"You've got shadow fear

Roll of the 12-sided dice
Roll of the 12-sided dice
Roll of the 12-sided dice
Roll of the 12-sided dice

I've got a profitable brain, supernatural eyes
Multiplied by
The galactic vigilante strapped twice
What's your answer, Dungeon Master?

Unimaginable awful blast on the face of this earth

Then you've got that right
I'm the tow truck
Of the soul land
I can get around you, I get you hyper
So forever, and ever
This will be spreaded across the livergaway
I am the way
I will take the weak out, put my thoughts right in
And then

Roll of the 12-sided dice
Roll of the 12-sided dice
Roll of the 12-sided dice

Do not attempt to avoid my thoughts
Climb out of the frying pan, you roast in the fire
Cleric, my character, I hope you recall
I am religious to what I believe in
Righteousness takes us away from the wrong
So have no
Right
And have no
Wrong

If we didn't have dark, we wouldn't need light

It's in the flow, it's in the flow
It's in the flow

Too unaccented explaining this man
My life could be long, my life could be short

I'm telling you tales about my quest
Empty factory studios
The weak and great shall not succeed
Makes your mind all go to pieces you would never leave
Wasteful to wait, most full thoughts
Time
Allows you to go, but you don't think fast

You don't think fast
You don't think fast
You don't think fast
You don't think fast

Look
Here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I ever known
I'm a hitchhiker
The guide to the galaxy
You're feeble, brittle, and sitting on the critical
I know I'm cease times table
I'm using a character, in this case a king
The same thing that I would wanna say
You see the crowd as an elastic, I'm pulling to the fold
When an immortal takes hold
The crowd is cold
Stun
This immortal is second to none
For here
This is my atmosphere

He pulls maces and knocks out faces
You need practice in order to extract us

All in one speech to teach that
Wisdom and power do not agree
So put fun and joke aside and come with me
I will guide you to everlasting light

You will learn how to live, and learn more why

Crime Pays,Young Buck,Rap,"(Young Buck)
State to state, slippin slate nigga
This for the block nigga
E'ry nigga out there who God damnit maintainin
Off slangin 'caine and all dem, thangs
And y'knowwhatI'mtalkinbout I feel that (I feel that)
See I done been in that situation where niggaz flip birds
Y'all know the gangsta, lil' young nigga
Who thugged out all night on the curb, came up from a GRAM

And bitch I got 'em warrin for 10-5, the new nigga in town
I'm the king of this drug ring, just waitin to be crowned
You havin' money by the ton, I got thousands by the pound
And the urge to splurge for all you niggaz want an ounce
Ain't no problem with the product, long as you got the amount
And every bit of my fetti, cause every bit of it count
I'ma roll in the low, rain snow hot or cold
Finish my narcotics and put my bitches on the road
First nigga try and jack, watch murder go kill them hoes
All white, no crack, how I get it, how it go
17 years old, I'm rappin' 10 at a time
To me, front shit ain't punk shit, long as I get mine
And we can get down to shine, no more sellin them dimes
Put 20's on our rides, fuck hoes with thick thighs
Then maybe you can see, how it is to be rich
You ain't heard about a nigga? I be servin' them bricks

Nightfall to sunshine, 24 hour shifts
If crime didn't pay, I'd be still on the strip {*repeat 2 lines 3X*}

I've survived off this cocaine game, and it's a strain to my brain
To front a nigga a thang, 'bout mine he won't complain
Conversation rule the nation, y'all niggaz know the sayin'
Prayin' I don't catch ya wit'cha watch I'll take ya out the picture
Money run the country, similar to Adolf Hitler
Always been to drugs but see it's different kind of dealers
You pay what you weigh, or should I say, get my scrilla
Not tomorrow but today, okay, it's on the real'a
I ain't tryin' to be a killer just a nigga 'bout his cheddar
And I ain't got it, you can't cancel the bill collector
Coulda been did your rump, put your family in the middle
But I chose to be a man and keep it on that level
Your potnahs done told you about this young runnin' rebel
And the load he carries behind if I can't get mine
So robbin niggaz blind is the way I'ma play the game
Gotta respect my mind and if you don't you still payin'

I'm a 100% for the Presidents
I never been hesitant, to leave 'em layin with no evidence
Gotta make the best of this, stack my cheese
Then come back and get the rest of it, transportin ki's
In the Benz with the leather kit, ride with me
When you hear that Desert Eagle click it's world war 3
This ain't how it 'posed to be, but ain't no fuckin' role model
Besides people down in hell still want ice water
Now how you livin' nigga? When hard times come
Can you stand prison nigga, or you gon' run yo' tongue?
What's that on yo' arm? You feel like it make a man?
Well let me get that and yo' charm, but turn around and count to 10
Can't turn soldier in one day, the thug gotta just be within
Your blood or yo' family, the streets gon' tell how good you been

Reality
Until it stood still now your far from a lie
When the truth tantalizes ya eyes see we'z
Already in the skies or outer space
Standing here on the face of this earth
To the state to the grid of my turf
Where my mom gave birth
To all that she loves be it small to othersbut yo its bigger than
Love
They did a cross examination of it

Talk about the iahp's with the fat ass and tits
Comin' to the club looking for a star
Ain't got ten dollars for a drink at the bar
Scoping around looking for the best dressed,
Smelling for the indo passing up the stress
Sniff sniff yo what does the iahp smell
A brotha like Suave with pockets that swell
Action was thrown the iahp was blown
Next thing you know I had her at my home
All alone object to get paid
The only thing that happened was her ass got laid
Now no end and her ass was sprung
Used a little tongue but believe I'm well hung
So listen, a lesson well learned for all you club hopping ho's
It ain't about the stardom and it ain't about the dough
So...

And step up to you respectfully

I don't intend to offend you
I only intend to befriend you
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me
With them hot pants, not a chance
I'mma let you go without saying something

No frontin' if it was illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance
On good behavior, maybe later
Maybe your apartment, your pad
Sike, joke, walking a tight rope
My foot in my mouth
Look, I hope is that you'll dance with me
What's up?

Repeat 1

She was smiling I was kind wiling
Thinking I'm dialin' in
She gave me the impression that she was getting my message
So I'm testing
I threw it out there 'Let me buy you a drink'
'Cause when I buy you I think it would be fly if we link
What'cha think?
She responded with a grin and a glance
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing
Mami can you feel me?
Still she said nothing
Why she be fronting?
Never seen another mami move like you
Groove like you
I'm saying I wanna dance with you
What's up?

Repeat 1

To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic
It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help emphasize
Some people dance socially not emotionally
Closer to me, come on close as you can be
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama cut me no slack
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama forward and back
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama as hard as you can
It's part of the plan
It happens when you start with the man
On your mark, ready set, baby let's go
Baby let's flow, baby let go
Baby no, no, gotta a lot more
Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that
*Girl yells*
Yeah that's it
Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me
It's better with me
Gain it, other girls I've dated ain't famous
So take it or leave it
Just the way that I eat it
I bring, I swing it
So you like that?
Tell me what's up

Blood stain the wall, when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin'
Unless you got my ends, I'ma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then (bam bam) say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, murder, respect, beer, honies and sex want here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin' with Chris, fuck Pun, dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggas I keep, I put 'em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill

Special two heated missles, till your crew's leavin' witchu
I rip you in half, blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little (ha ha) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talkin' loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew? Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fittin' to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Grip you like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy, probably robbin' your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North, stashin' knives up my ass
Survivin' the task, we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips, fast as fast'll spit

Hey Ladies,Beastie Boys,Rap,"Hey...
Hey ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh

Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
I date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion

I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
I'm wheelin' and dealin', I make a little bit of stealing
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling

Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwing
I'm talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing, well..

She's talking to the kid (to the kid)
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did
Hey ladies *a get funky*
*All the ladies in the house*
*The ladies, the ladies*

Well...
Me in the corner with a good looking daughter
I dropped my drawers and said ""Welcome Back Kotter""
We was cutting up the rug, she started cutting up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her please stop it (well)

The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a drag
Educated no, stupid yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh

I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in Charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white Sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville then

I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records, a number one sound (just)

Just step to the rhythm, step step to the ride
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in, tune on, to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive

Hey ladies *a get funky*
Hey hey hey hey ladies
*Girls girls*
Hey hey hey hey ladies
One more time *ain't it funky now*
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
*Ain't it funky*

You know that..
She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time and then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl, it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh, go and mail that ear

Call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'
Said come on over, it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed

Your old lady left you and you went (girls girls girls) insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train, well...
Take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man

Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the One Ton Ho
'Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce

Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
*She thinks she's the passionate one*

Hey ladies *a get funky*
*What's that*
*Good god*
*Good god* *Damn*
*Good god*
*Baby baby baby baby*

*Is it funky brother?*

The Last Song,Above The Law,Rap,"(Featuring n.w.a.)
Yo d.o.c., what'cha blazing, j, 'cause this is a lawhouse
Experience, so you know it's gonna be some mega shit, so who is that
(Km.g)
Km.g will never be a trick
Step up to the mic like a baller then I pimp this gift
That only I possess
I illustrated that way to get the shit off my chest
I'm ghetto raise to amaze the crowd, it's quite simple
Km.g has degrees from unity of south central
I'm a graduate and it's all legit
From the pimping, the ballin' and all that good shit
I have the mega balls in which I speak in a slang
While I'm peeking it wit the g's from the ruthless gang
Ain't nuttin change but the weather like I said before
'Cause I'm living like hustlers and I'm checking galore
Yo, I have to give it up to the d.o.c.
A ruthless brother who's down wit the km.g
So all hail to the niggas that's turning it out
And maybe then, I'll take the gun barrel out of your mouth
Knowledge from one generation to another, perserve
And then transmitted, get it, done the ruthless way,
You know what I'm saying, so what's up dre
(Dr. dre)
Now I'm a swinger, I'm not a muthafuking singer
But I bringa melody that always seems to ring a
Bell as well, let's make it so you can tell
Yo, it's coming from compton where the ballers dwell
'Cause I'm dre, the muthafuking doctor causing propaganda
When I'm on the mic, I demand a
Little bit of time to express myself
From ?(cedian)? wax, kicking the facts and it's like that
A nigga wit a muthafuking attitude
You know the deal, kicking some real shit
And if a sucker ever thinks he can get some
Yo, step off, I'm kicking lyrics for the deaf and the dumb
But any occasion, getting the bitches wit the mega persuasion
Then my dick starts top make an invasion
But, yo, I can't go on
Because this is the end of my part on the last song
Real g from the streets, villianous when he speaks
For all you busters who can't deal, give it up for real
(MC ren)
Now when you see me, you're ducking and slipping, yo, then you fell
Down
You fucked up and finally figured who was the cell down
Pulling the pulls, crotching the bull
The weak muthafuker was smelling like shit so I guess that they're
Full
Of it, and I love it when I dress like a crook
Wit a ""i don't give a fuck"" look
The villain was something nuff like a hero
Jacking all the niggas wit beef, off of relief, I mean the zeros
The rest of the 100 was sent to do what I say
Nwa and atl and we don't play
The doc is doing it, oh, so correctly
See, I broke it down for the ones who try to check me
But I can't be check 'cause I'm the checker
When you see a nigga wreck believe that I'm the wrecker
The right and for the fight and the left will attend
We're doing wrong, MC ren is on the last song
From a genius to temporary insanity, the gangster's dream
The bitches fanasty, ruthless, so now we've come to the payoff
(Eazy-e)
One muthafuking two muthafuking three
It's the hip-hop thugster eazy-e
So I grab the mic and then I clear my throat
First nigga kicking lyrics in a straightcoat
It's eazy for me to come off like this
So you can kiss my ass where the sun rays miss
Or just give me the pussy and I'll be straight
And if you don't, fuck it, I'll masterbate
(We wanta fuck you eazy) yeah, you bitches scream
Now bow down and praise the lord for the wing ding
I got skill to deal and run game on bitches
You can tell that I'm sick by the triple sixes
I hear voices in my head for what reason
But when the talking stops (pow) it's drive by season
So back the fuck off and give me respect
Now they're shipping me off 'cause eazy played wit a half deck
Criminal in his thoughts, murderous in his lyrics
The notorious cold
(Cold 187um)
187um, you know I gotta have it
Now being above the law is an everyday habit
If you think I drop some pimp shit, I ain't
Perhaps I'll say a couple rhymes to make the bitches faint
Now everybody wants to chill, ill
And bill, now what the fuck is the deal
You need a nigga like me to get the shit going
187um has got the ultimate flowing
Now it's time for me to go off like a maniac
Run up for cover 'cause I'm on the ?(adidnac)?
An untouchable player rolled up into one mind
87 reasons why fools staying in line
'Cause I ain't the average nigga behind the trigger
I lay and spray anything in my way
'Cause I'm a balls player for the streets of south central
Believe what you want but soon you'll eventually see
That atl is straight to mega
Don't be surprise 'cause we played ya like sega
And these bodies keep dropping, you see me keep moving on
Peace, I'm outta here 'cause this is the last song

Fast Life,Kool G Rap,Rap,"The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

Verse One: Kool G Rap

Champagne wishes of caviar dreams, a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the life of rowdy packin fifty cali's
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that betray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used to shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin' straight charming in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army
The celo rollers money folders sippin bola holdin' mad payola
Slangin a Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son

Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American dream
So we're plottin up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
(Repeat 2X)

Verse Two: Nas Escobar

Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggaz be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin up my Lex over who's petrol
My tec blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots, holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallaby down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The luciano Frankie Aiello, Bugsy Seagal
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

*Singer* Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeah, get this money, yeah
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, hey yeah yeah

Verse Three: G Rap, Nas

[Rap] Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
[Nas] It's choir attire standin on ground with one pivot
[Rap] Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
[Nas] Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
[Rap] Bodies on ice
[Nas] Livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
[Rap] Gamblin Grants
[Nas] Handlin stamps
[Duo] Moves are sheist
[Nas] My bank grows, got the cops comin' in plain clothes
[Rap] Tryin' to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[Rap] Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm and Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside ?perico?
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites, deep, rippin beats with flows
[Rap] Aiyyo, we went from standin on blocks, without some socks
Sellin rocks, to pickin' up stock and boat docks with glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

Hip-hop scholar since bein knee-high to a duck
The height of Mugsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

(Q-Tip)
Queens is in the house represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
No tamin of the style 'cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent

Huh-huh, here we go
You know that I'm the rebel
Throwin' out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpas drawers, don't test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we comin' through get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so therell never be a preemie
Lyrics are abundant 'cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle 'cause the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right
Now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness

(Phife)
New York City represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent

MCs like to meddle, but heres my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and jumped your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?

(Q-Tip)
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from cryin
So much goin' on, people killin', people dyin'
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental

(Phife)
Yo I take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver
Percussion isn't less, D's wear the vest
While they dodgin bullets, you should be dodgin Quest
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pele
Tip educateem, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo

(Q-Tip)

Okay
I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices
We all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears
These are my views and you will find that
We revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freakin globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the ball
We welcome competion 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the fattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the fattest also to stay alive"
Midnight,A Tribe Called Quest,Rap,"Q-Tip:
The night is my mind
The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme

See, Jake be gettin' illy when the sun get dark
They be comin' out the heads, but shit don't let me start
Their activities are plenty in nighttime (nighttime)
For the ghetto child, it seems to be the right time
See, kids be gettin' stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Runnin' to the corner, the dice game is blazin'
Lookin' at the loot, it seems so amazin
Puts it short down, to be exact would bound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down (uh!)
Scam money don't make none
He threw a trip on the ace, now he's out son
Hits the local bodega to woof down a hero
Son is on a 'Midnight Run' like De Niro
Spots the shorty rock standin on his block
The thieves be handlin in the pumps, so he asked it it's not
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, his dance sure was a fly one
Took her to the crib there she ran her gibs
About mind upliftment and bein positive
He yawned and he sighed till 1:05
Then he finally realized that hunny wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on buildin for the evenin'
Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leavin'
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Sam with the blunt in his hand
(Aww Shhh...!) You know the transaction
Brothas gettin' lost in the weed satisfaction
Comin' down the block man loud as (fuck)
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt
They interrupt ya cipher, and crush ya blunt
See you left your work at home, so they pat you down for nothin'
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin?
You push to the park, even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot ya troop'

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind, the night is on the mind
The night is on your mind
A yo, the sun'll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
As for me...

I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates
On a young black man, who makes the niggaz speak a shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the J can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, a yo, I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and sirens of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my gibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough

The night is on my mind, the sun'll still shine
The night is on my mind, the night is on my mind
The night is on my mind, yeah, the sun'll still shine
But now, uh huh, the night is on my mind
The night is on your mind, you know the sun'll still shine
But now the night is on the mind, yeah, the night is on my mind
The night is on the mind, a yo, the sun'll still shine
But now the night is on the mind, yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind, a yo, the sun'll still shine"
Invasion,Jeru The Damaja,Rap,"Police all on my dick like I shot somebody
Cause of these big ass lips and I rock my locks knotty
Life is getting hectic Tupac got shot in the nuts
You saw cops was corrupt when Rodney King got fucked up
With friends like these who needs enemies constantly harassing,
Filling up my nuts like a Klansman
Snatching up a nigga for nuttin I heard bad guys wear black
So I guess I'm the motherfucking villain
Under pressure they got me under pressure
What's your name your address and phone number
Your occupation come down to the station
There's been a robbery they claim a nigga fit the description
It can't be, so I slides out on em
In ninety-five you gotta catch a nigga, if you want him
One to three, and five to ten
Bullies in blue suits Son with automatic weapons
I'm stressed, ready to blow up somethin'
The beast keep frontin, invasion

I was forced into a life of crime
Career criminal, now my career is crime
My mind is in a fucked up state
A brainwashed state, is the black man's fate, in the ground
Or locked down upstate, when I was young I used to shoot for the stars
But got shot down by demons in patrol cars
Stars good cop, bad cop, stick up the crack spot
The ave won't get hot till one of their crew gets shot
Ask, Larry Davis, how much they took
Cops and crooks, but who's the crooks?
Take a nigga to jail, make bail, guilty or innocent
The system gets ten percent
Frontin like you're doin' somethin'
But you ain't sayin' nothin', invasion

Come up in my cipher best believe I'ma dip on that ass
Beast-boy I'm professional heart of the ghetto
Raised, in the ways of thugs
Dodgin slugs, takin' slugs, driving stolen automobiles
Skills fantastical
Living life on the edge it's dramatic, mad drama
I'm a fanatic, adrenalin addict
Getaway car, stick shift or automatic
Where's my crew at, you got your crew scopin
For a nigga up and down the Ave, it makes me laugh
Eat my nuts, eat my dust
I won't spend the night locked up or in handcuffs
'Cause in the conrete jungle, I got the right stuff
Smooth operator, pilot and navigator
Break out from oppression, my mission to escape
The invasion"
Rollin' With My Homies,Coolio,Rap,"Saturday morning, take the train for a ride
The sun is up, I got my homies by my side
Rollin' down the street with my sixteen speakers
... On the beach, daddy dippin'
I hang a light at the right, ready to have fun
Then I bust a left for the 121
Pull it into park and lay it on the grass
I roll back the ride, so I can see some ass
Clock one sista, fifteens in the rear
Bump a forty, leaves me gawkin' here
I hits 'em up for the circle, that's how I'm livin'
Crowbars in the house and got us on a mission
You can be Blood, or you can see Cryppin' fool
But I ain't trippin'
My homie Snoop kicks the dinner juice and that's all right,
But a-Coolio with the flow seems to yak all night

Rollin' with my homies (sippin' we yak all night, yeah)
Sippin' on yak all night (I got us on the way in the CBT, and it's all right)
Yak all night...
Rollin' with my homies (sippin' yak all night, yeah)
Sippin' on yak all night (I got us on the way in the CBT, and it's all right)
Yak all night

Pumpin' up the keg and roll it in a paper
It's like a match, you light it up and pass it to your neighbour
Night time is the right time... a-Dynamite!
We're gonna have a good time
I jump back in the wagon, lock up the ass
Pop in the tape and a match
West when I fly I take the exit o'
And guess what I saw
Two fools at the light, they stared me up
But I just look 'em in the eye and I say, ""Wassup?""
And even though I really don't want no trouble
I got thirty-one replies to bust your bubble
I don't really wanna hurt nobody

So I keeps on rollin' on my way to the party
I just wanna kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Pass me the cup so we can get twisted

Rollin' with my homies (sippin' we yak all night, yeah)
Sippin' on yak all night (I got us on the way in the CBT, and it's all right)
Yak all night...
Rollin' with my homies (sippin' yak all night, yeah)
Sippin' on yak all night (I got us on the way in the CBT, and it's all right)
Yak all night

I'm rollin' with my homies, yeah
'Said we'd yak all night, yeah yeah

I roll up to the party and I'm straight old bent
And 'catchin' me a freak was my intent
There's a whole pack o' rats' ass standin' in the front
So I drops the ass and let the sistas bump
Here comes one now, she's on the tip
She says she likes the way my woofers kick
But I don't fall in love with every girl I see
So I pass up two and go straight to three
She got a ass like the back of a bus, 'cause
And that's why I say...
I let her hit my twenty, got straight to the point
Wassup? Do you wanna kick it or what?
I ain't got time to be frontin', I ain't talkin' 'bout nuttin' Just a little sumpin' sumpin'
If you're fine and you won't front
I don't wanna be your man, but I'll hook you up.

Rollin' with my homies (sippin' we yak all night, yeah)
Sippin' on yak all night (I got us on the way in the CBT, and it's all right)
Yak all night...
Rollin' with my homies (sippin' yak all night, yeah)

(Crypt Speaking)
Yo, OS, Celph Titled baby
What's goin' down

(Celph Speaking)
My niggaz, yo spit that shit

(Crypt The Warchild)
I'ma known beast sick with it full blown speech
Buryin' bones deep beneath the stone streets
Stampedin the globe deep with the Pharaohs so don't sleep
We flame arrow your dome piece but when these cannibals go eat
I'ma cannon with no leash no hammer and no heat
Spit at random anytime acapella with no beat
Believe me dog cyclop vision I see through fog
Y'all transparent niggaz on tape I see through y'all
Like a crystal ball, my dogs gnaw till ya tissues gone shook
When niggaz ran to they pistols to hit you hard
This games a fixed neck, go ahead and pick your card
Like playin' Russian roulette by yaself on a trip to Mars
I break atoms in the same fashion I spit these bars
Put barbwire on my mic rip it tight till it slips and scars
Outerspace get it right we shift and drift from y'all
Outerspace get it right we shift and drift from y'all

(Outerspace X2)
It's a revolution, a new state of mind
We bringin' hip hop back with new ways to rhyme
Yesterday it was dark but today we shine
Tryin' to make the best out these last days in time

(Planetary)
Stick me in a room with a track Celph Title made
No tellin' where my ink flow it's like a tidal wave
Battle emcees dog I survived those days
Now it's murderous spittin' fire those pyros crave
Makin' joints from the gutter, the grittiest rhyme
Sorry if you think I'm rude I get too shitty at times
I'm with Crypt on barstools talkin' rep, cars and pool
Tryin' to build foundation with no garage and tools
With a squad that bruise anybody who act
Outta order Q-Demented will demolish you cats
Outta water outta food, we grisslin' niggaz
Don't speak, 'cause you know your body fittin' in rivers
Don't sleep, does who slept don't pose a threat
We runnin' with the Army now Pharaohs to the death
We are, what you hard renegades wanna be
We spit regardless, no matter center stage or the street

(Celph Titled)
Yo, first off let me say fuck you and fuck dead homies
You got beef with me you got beef with my cronies
And when it come to machineguns, we fire Tommy's like Sony
Leave you missin' from your tribe like Jahrobee
We block buster spot rushers; my shots musta'
Let off from the glock and sprayed you down like crop dusters
I rock mustard color Timbs the same ones that busted ya chin
Celph Titled and Outerspace the spicks is at it again
Get a number for it to drop through
See me with a 4-4 when I drop through
That's my bitch and I don't think she likes you
And all that bullshit about let there be light
It wasn't that easy plus I gave life to Christ
Immortalized my story noticed that I eternally rep
Bring mother Mary to Maury Povich paternity test
Their ain't a nigga that can play, that's preposterous G
'Cause I'll make sure ya album is released posthumously"
Liar,Madcon,Rap,"You the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need
Girl I'm stuck on you
So it's so hard to set me free
You the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need
You a liar, liar

It was the love, pain, sweat, ties
That made me stick
When I was sick of the lies
The years, tears, smiles, fights
And now that I left you
I cry through the night

You was quick to slip
The slicker slice
I was surprised how you kept your calm

And every time you admit deceit
We'd hit the sheets
I started livin' on the bedroom floor
Probably you's a liar
Yeah, tryin' to call the car
Try to leave anytime
But a false alarm
Because you the one that did me wrong
Girl you a liar!

Like the beat don't stop
First let it slide, before I cut in
And suddenly the beat goin' stomp

You the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need
Girl I'm stuck on you
So it's so hard to set me free
You the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need
You a liar, liar

(I just wanted the truth)
I said she lied to me
Can't believe a word she cries
'Cause she lied to me
No need to work things up
'Cause she's a dyer, a pretty bad liar
But she's hot too
Making it hard to move that sexy scene
'Cause it's not true

First I thought I
Never knew a love like this
And this wasn't a first half order?
First I caught her
Givin' it a hooch?
In truth, this love worse
Than my first time order.?
Be real, bet ya man don't lie
That promise'll give the candle fry?
*** What they say 'bout a man don't cry
'Cause I know it's not love proper
I'm gonna die

You the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need
Girl I'm stuck on you
So it's so hard to set me free
You the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need
You a liar, liar

I said she lied to me
Can't believe a word she cries
'Cause she lied to me
No need to work things up
'Cause she's a dyer, a pretty bad liar
But she's hot too
Making it hard to move that sexy scene
'Cause it's not true.
She seemed to be the truth
(Seemed to be the truth)
I bet she cheated on me too
(Cheated on me too)
She really got me good
(Really got me good)

I said she really got me good
(Really got me good)
Hey you the first thing I would choose
But the last thing I need

Catch 22,Tinchy Stryder,Rap,"I call it preview
Cause that was just a preview

I'm in my zone
I'm really in the zone
This place is full of plastic face
I call him sillicone, cone, yeah
And I think I miss my home
I think they kinda miss me too
But the love is really shown
No, 'cause I ain't talkin' bout my family
Talkin' bout some real friends
That used to stand beside me
They think I'm a millionaire
They whisper words behind me
Roll ... still here
So I respect them highly
They know I'm in the game
And I know I top the charts
I need them all to feel my pain
This is the part I can't explain
Industry twisted,
This a complicated business
Tryna bring them friends is easier said

Than done, believe this
It's either this or that
The top is a lonely place
The hood, the roads ain't safe
The writing's there ...in blood
And this is what I dreamed about
But in the dream I weren't alone
The stars, a home

It's a catch 22
I call it catch 22
This is catch 22"

All my Detroit players, let's go!

I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck. I ain't
Gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned

You gave right, yes I love menage-a-trois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big ""wah""
I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggaz on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
But choke a dunkadunk, keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump to me my .9's in the trunk
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers tryin' to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shit
My chap lips will cut nipples when breast fed
And on the way, leave the bread with Achman (?)
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
With a fat chick that eat cake on playskates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grace
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape

(Swift)
I'ma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman hear gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doin' is pursuin' a dream
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lyin', bullshittin' each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber
He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
Or my wife, and my sisters. So motherfuck a mistress
They signin' a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in there motherfuckin' face

(Bizarre)
What's your name again? It doesn't matter
My name is Bizzy, a bodygaurd for Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl. Let me get you a drink
I'ma buy you a mink, and rape you in the sink
From day one, I knew you was a hoe
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pads

(Kuniva)
These hoes be on some bullshit. Always tryin' to pull shit
Outta they ass. Get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you
Sucked you, put it on you, boned you
Yappin' off with they mouth sayin' she loved you
All on your dick, callin' your phone, spazzin' and shit
Havin' a fit until you feel like callin' it quits
Then she starts callin' your chick
Wantin' to fight. Everytime you show up at a gig
She front row with her friends. Flippin' you off
Follow you to the bar, the bathroom
The parkin' lot, to the car, pissin' you off
Until you blackout, now you and the hoe is havin' a scrapout
You get locked up for assault and now you asked out"

Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
So re-load quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
You steppin' with .007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But wtch the god get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't no .38
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma
Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path
Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I
Reduced the friction with crucifixion
Let loose the mix then
Boost the piston
Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that
I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm hit another M.C.
Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when
Music is louder
Full of gunpower
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of
Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss
But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines that
I have to hit
Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up
You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around THE RA with aN army
You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em
With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in
Let it split 'I'm
Since he brought his main man wit' 'I'm
He ask me how I did 'I'm
I let the rhythm hit 'I'm
Let it hit 'I'm

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhyth with ral rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here let me introduce you
Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a HABIT
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose
Too many milligram
NO ONE made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'I'm
He'll never forget 'I'm
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em
At least when he left he'll know what hit 'I'm
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know you'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, THEY'LL catch up, hell no
Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it
To perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'
Blood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbit'
'Cause when I explained ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein
Then remain, let it radiate
Vibes will vibrate
Why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style brak
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone
Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach HER intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let the write reflect
Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder
EEverything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er"

Young Girl Bluez,Biz Markie,Rap,"""Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said"" - Slick Rick (Repeat 4x)

I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
36-24-36, I looked to her and I said ""I need a fix""
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1-800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off, then I will be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond, I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21, here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez

""Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said"" (Repeat 4x)

As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1-800 beeper
Call my looney, crazy, psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
Come and get me from Mickey D's at 8
That's where I work after school, pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle? I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez

""Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said"" (Repeat 4x)

Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay then why don't you get that through the judge's head
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked ""What do you want?"" She said ""A pair of earrings""
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrive kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew I would be a disgrace
""How old are you now?"" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed ""Sixteen!""
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez!

""Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said"" (Repeat 4x)"
Yoke The Joker (LP Version),Naughty By Nature,Rap,"Yoke the Joker!
*Laughter*

Intro: Treach

There are too many overnight MC's but one
And too many wacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
And we are Naughty By Nature, and we will just do, by terminating you

Verse 1: Treach

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fuckin' joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losin is small talk
I ain't a punk, I'll slot'cha, furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you 'pussy' 'cause you are what you eat, each
Look is a little closer to the centre of a blowpipe
Don't speak when I am talkin', this is my fuckin' sho-op
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
You're smilin' backstage doin' mother, ugh, doggystyle
Hot, wild, raw, whores' still suave
*Laughter* Check out this style that I've
Soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
Semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slappin suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slammin' stouch, mackin this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
Snaps steppin separate, start slowly, go solo
Set the cassette stereo, sounds diffin
Stood the Sagittarian, some marriage is a system
Smoke the joker, three times over
And owe her, go with the flow
Or I'm about to yoke a joker

Verse 2: Treach

All that straight faced shit like your heart had been through
Smile and give your face somethin' the fuck to do
You're ugly, smugly, squiggly, dilly-wrinkled faced bastard
Someone needs to hit and run ya to run ya ass over backwards
Let's giddy up, yep yep, another fuck up
Grab your microphone, battle time shown up
Any freestyle I see while I prowl
I dial a new style, tell me about ooh-chow
Another victory, it's mystery
I smoke your skull, your brain'll come blistery
All fuzzy, dirty, dizzy, does he
Get the things he needs? Remember how blistery?
You ain't ready for the Freddy of rap
You can't kill me, I step into your dreams, you feel me
Slicin your life away, just like I might today
I eat you the psycho way, I'm rippin shit right away...
I treat ya like a bitch in a ditch off of angel dust
Take you to a ????, sure you can fly, just jump slut
You think you might say a rhyme, then someone might order like
You couldn't wet shit up in a motherfuckin water fight
All luck y'all, look at the props y'all
So proud I'm sure, suck my encore's
Swingin' a bolo, your flow goes solo
I'll smoke ya
It's time to yoke the joker

Verse 3: Treach

The only way you would be gettin' dis jump like a girlie
Is if your father would've bothered to pull it out early
You ain't got a single drip drop, you're stripped of hip-hop
If I see ya disagreein, you'll be gettin' your shit dropped
It's extended version, the side you can't fuck with
You'll get the jimmy MC, you're swift to kick the bucket
I'm tired of Mr. Nice Guy, place your price high
Bet on a battle rhymer, tell my chances are sky high
Never would you ever get the thriller, say y'all sweat
""Y'know that kid Treach, I took him out, he was no threat""
Because you know I'm better than that on my worst day
Takin' competition's what I do in the worst way
Quick to do a hit, for you most likely I spoiled ya
I bored and ignored ya, then boringly floored ya
The proof is in the footin, my collar ain't wooden
It takes more than an axe to tax, bless the children
Physically, facially, racially made to be
Crazily paid or G, what a fuckin' way to be
Hot damn, I'm a man with a hand plan
This smack that then attract the new game plan
Eat your big beef, digest the rest, test
Shit, I was slept yet, then go to the next step
That's what I do, that's what I say, that's what I live
That's what I prove, that's what I move, that's what I give
Makin' other brothers wanna go home and write shit
Bite what I might get, then up and say ""I quit""
Me here, got, oh what a beautiful dawg
>From you ain't in amazing, want some paper plus a pen and tongue will do
Yoke the joker!"
All Balls,Aceyalone,Rap,"Yeah, say what
Now, how the god damn pot go and call the kettle black?
That bull shit
Yo, but this ain't though
Chapter seven, verse one, attention

All balls don't bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang
And some people have a ball doin' they thang
Now what's the result? Your life is biased
All one-sided, surrounded by liars

Trials and tribs
It's all ad-libs and all breakin' you a coupla ribs
Now what if I breaks the tail on the lizard
Is it gonna grow back? It is and you know that

But that ain't the case, I picture the place
I capture a Kodak and show dat face
You're just a shit stain on the draws of life
And the trials of life and the styles of life

You won't be happy 'til you lost your life
Or lose your mind, or die of boredom
Or try to kill 'em all and let your God sort 'em
Better earn your keep and learn to leap or burn in your sleep

Tryin' to get a little somethin', yo, I peep
You bein' devoted
But you shoulda let it seep
Through the mask you sported

You ended up a swiggler caught in a swiggle
Just gimme the signal and I'll state the terms
As long as I can be there with fate to change
You smokin' sherm

Or whatever the name, you're a trivial part in a trivia game
Now what's your aim? A presidential campaign
Like Ross Perot, he lost it though
But he got a billion in da bank for show

Oh, me, I'm po' and you like me
But I don't like you, nigga, you all fronts
And I won't let one apple spoil the bunch
Now get yo' hat and get yo' coat

All afloat, we goin' back to the real
I got a question, answer me this
What if me and you got caught in a twist
And you accidentally got caught by the fist?

What's the gist, or what's the justice
Or better yet, what if I had got busted
For tryin' to go out like General Custer?
Well, kiss yo' family, meet me at the juncture
Better have a little bit a acupuncture

I reckon that you gonna have to smoke another bongload
To get you enough
To open your mouth
Because I doubt that you know what it's really about

All balls don't bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang
And some people have a ball doin' they thang
Now what's the result? Your life is biased
All one-sided, surrounded by liars

Heard you keep your jewels in a safe
That ain't safe with a ten-dollar locket
I keep mines in between my front pockets
'Cause I'm a darkie and they want me

Castrated, assassinated, well, here's your merit
Better wear it with pride, just don't get all mushy inside
And don't get pushy or wishy washy, your heart is squishy
When it should be strong, your tail is bushy

When you shouldn't even have one
Do you want another big hit of the bong?
All balls don't bounce, now you wanna get indignant
Show your stupidity and act all ig'nant

Now you got pigment, so you my kin
It's like the hand, it's still on ice
So you might starve tryin' to carve you a slice
With a little brown rice and some black eye peas

Or two black eyes and two broke knees
And two broke niggas tryin' to steal the cheese
Got family ties, your family's giving
Your family tries, your family's living

Your family croaks, dies of a stroke
And that's the end
But then you awoke
As a baby again

So in your next life, you can be squabbler
And eat peach cobbler till you get fat
You can even live in a mansion or a wigwam
Just remember all balls go flat

All balls don't bounce, all balls don't bounce and the nonce know
All balls don't bounce and [unverified] know
All balls don't bounce and [unverified] know
All balls don't bounce, [unverified] know

All balls don't bounce, Abstract know
All balls don't bounce, Fat Jack know
All balls don't bounce, [unverified] know
All balls don't bounce, CV Shack [unverified] know

All balls don't bounce, Ganjah K know
All balls don't bounce, my nigga, Jupiter know
All balls don't bounce, Volume ten know
All balls don't bounce [unverified] know

All balls don't bounce, [unverified] know
All balls don't bounce, Tyrone know
All balls don't bounce, the West Coast know
All balls don't bounce, the East Coast know

All balls don't bounce
The World know
All balls don't bounce
All balls don't bounce
All balls don't bounce"
90 Degrees,DL Incognito,Rap,"Check it out y'all

The Sun is out man, it's hot as hell, summertime
Summertime shine, summertime rhyme, enjoy yourselves

Sorry I'm leaving
I'll be back from tour
I'm everywhere now like a corner store
I've pulled myself up from the concrete floor
I knocked on the door
But ain't nobody answer yet
Can't dwell on that
For summer is here
My horoscope said it's gonna be great year
It's going be lots of cookouts and lots of beers
A whole lot of shows, a whole lot of cheers
It's my preferred season
For mad reasons
The world's shitty place, but I'm glad I'm breathing
For those months
Niggas smoke trees and get drunk
Just add a Heineken, and a Crunch to my lunch nigga
My windows down
My system pounds
The bassline's strong enough to shake the ground
The sound is adored the young people
It's so lethal
Forever things change like the Beatles
But...

It's like 90 degrees, it's the start of my day
I'm trying to find a tree, I'm trying to find shades
I'm trying use me time in a productive way
I'm trying to get money, I'm trying to get paid (x2)

Relax and groove
We move in crews
The summer is the time for the BBQ's nigga
The kicks are new
The threads are to
Just chilling downtown like my people all do
I'm in my prime, I'm just trying to come up
Not a care in the world, not giving a fuck
It's all day everyday
Girls around the way
Got too many to choose from it's prime real-estate
So we play the field for real
And press our luck
Sometimes we get stuck
But we never give up
'Cause it's the thrill of the hunt that keep us moving
And a one stand is just an illusion
The night, life is better, with warm weather
She got a Jetta
Plus a friend that look a lot better
I got a team niggas always down for cause
Plus down with y'all
Fallow like the wizard of OZ

The sun is out so we hand wash rides
Got no more drama like Mary J Blige
Got no time to waste indoor or inside
Skateboards, mountain bikes, never on-line
Got a new car with leather air
Still not from the year
Need GPS son will help me steer
I got a hook up, connected like chain mail
So before I hit the block my shit get detailed
Get It waxed, vacuumed buffed and cleaned
For now a 4.6 is out of my reach
I know my music ain't lifeless
One on the nicest
I keep rising like gasoline prices
My stress levels at an all time low
I know
Things can't stay beautiful
But for now captivated like a love potion
It's the summertime, just trapped in the moment

I'm trying to get brain
I'm trying to get laid
I'm trying to get on stage
I'm trying to get everything, you think that's strange? Summertime!"

It's My Thing,EPMD,Rap,"{Helicopter flies overhead}

""It's my thing!""

""And the stadium is packed...
There's a large crowd out there today...
Let's hear them play""

""You out there? louder!""
""It's my thing!""

""You out there? louder!""
""It's my thing!""

(Parrish smith)
MC's out there, you better stand clear
Epmd is a world premier
From new york straight talk, America's best
Cold wild long island, is where we rest

(Erick sermon)
(""You out there? louder!"")
Style of the rap, makes your hands clap
Take care of myself because the lines are strapped
Day mean business, no time for play
If you bite a line, we'll roll your way
(""You out there? louder!"")
The more you bite, your body gets hot
Don't get too close, because you might get shot
Gnawin at my rhyme like a poisonous rat
Don't play dumbo, you're smarter than that

(Pmd) it's my thing

""It's my thing!""
""You out there? louder!""

""It-it, it, it-it, it-it, it's my thing!""

(Parrish smith)
The rhythmatic style, keeps the rhyme flowin
Good friends already bitin, without you knowin'
(""You out there? louder!"")
Can't understand, why your body's gettin' weaker
Then you realize, it's the voice from the speaker
The mind become delirious, situation serious
Don't get ill, go and get curious
(""It's my thing!"")

(Erick sermon)
Nuff about that, let's get on to somethin' better (""louder!"")
And if gets warm, take off the hot sweater
And if you want some water, I'll get you a cup
And if you don't want it, then burn the hell up
(""You out there? louder!"")
I'm tellin' you now boy, you ain't jack
Talkin' much junk like mr. t at your back
But he's not, so don't act cute
'Cause if you do you in hot pursuits

(Pmd) it's my thing

""It's my thing!""
""You out there? louder!""

""It-it, it, it-it, it-it, it's my thing!""

(Parrish smith)
As the song goes on you will notice a change
The way I throw down, the way I say my name
(""You out there? louder!"")
The mic that I'm packin, is flame resistant
So MC be cool, and keep your distance
When I walk into the party girls are screamin at me
I park my mic and my hoes, and then I yell freeze...
... Music please

""It's my thing!""

(Erick sermon)
Ah where was i? oh yes
Say a def rhyme then I plumb the rest
(""You out there? louder!"")
Everytime I rock a rhyme I can tell that you like it
Emotion is strong, like the mind of a psychic
The mind is weary, floatin like a dove
Sweating and things, like cause you was makin' love
Control the crowd, so they can accept it
Total concentration is the perfect method

(Pmd) it's my thing

""It's my thing!""
""You out there? louder!""

""It-it, it's my, it-it, it's my thing!""

(Parrish smith)


The wack I subtract, the strong I attack
The ones who grab the mic and freeze, I throw it back
(""You out there? louder!"")
I perfect and eject, make MC's sweat
Take 'em off on the mic then I tell 'em step
Not waiting or debating, cause MC's keep hating
Play me too close, like two dogs mating
(""It's my thing!"")

(Erick sermon)
(""You out there? "")
Now let's get on with the rest of the lesson
Don't really like it when suckers start messin
Tryin' to make a scene, talkin' very loud
Talkin' much junk to attract a crowd
(""You out there? louder!"")
You say you wanna battle, your first mistake
You get quiet and stuff, like you was at a wake
In the beginnin, you knew you wasn't winnin'
Now you feel ashamed, your head starts bendin
Kinda upset boy -- I understand
You lost again -- I won, God damn

(Pmd) it's my thing

""It's my thing!""
""You out there? louder!""

""It-it, it, it-it, it-it, it's my thing!""

(Parrish smith)
My funky fresh lyrics, put you in the spirit
I speak a little louder for you suckers can't hear it
(""You out there? louder!"")
The rhymes I designed, are right on time
And at the crowd on my mic, flash a danger sign
'Cause I'm the thriller of manilla, MC cold killer
Drink budweiser, cannot stand miller
MC's cold clockin till the party's through
Then they tap me on my shoulder and say, ""this bud's for you""
(""It's my thing!"")

(Erick sermon)
(""You out there? louder!"")
To be a real MC, you can't be obedient
To be smooth is the main ingredient
You have to be silky like a milky way
To be able to make it work, you rest and play
(""You out there? louder!"")
I control the pace of the rate the rhymes blowin'
Hydraulically jacked, is the way they're flowin
Slow yes, just like they're awed
The comparison is wave like the motion of water, smooth...

""It's my thing!""
""You out there? louder!""

""It-it, it, it-it, it-it, it's my thing!""

(Parrish smith)
While the record is spinnin, got your fly girlie grinnin
Md is on the mic, you know I'm only beginnin
(""You out there? louder!"")
Rhymes fresher than fresh, never heard me fess
Scored 110, on my MC test
My rhymes are strong than tyson, hold a MC license
When I grab the mic, MC's get frightened

(Erick sermon)
(""You out there? louder!"")
I'm dangerous, I'm here to crush some bones
Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone (""it's my thing!"")
What I mean by lounge, I don't mean bitin, huh
You mess around, and we'll be fightin
It's all right if you bite, but don't recite
Because the rhymes are mine, and that ain't right
(""You out there? louder!"")
But until just chill to the next episode
Donald j, yo, release the code

(Pmd) it's my thing

""It's my thing!""
""It's my thing!""
""You out there? ""

""It-it, it, it-it, it-it, it's my thing!""

""It's my thing! it's my thing! it's my thing!""
(""You out there? louder!"")
""It-it, it, it-it, it-it, it's my thing!""

""La-la-loud-la-loud-la-louder!""
""It's my thing!""
""You out there? louder!""
""It's my thing!"" *music fades*
""You out there? ""
""Ya ya ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya you out there? """

You never was a killa; you never bust a gun

You never lived my life; you deadin' it wrong
'Cause you never did none of the shit that you said in your song

With the strength of a hundred baboons
I'll beat your eyes black as a fuckin' raccoon
Leave you covered with stab wounds
Dead in a public bathroom
You like to tighten your face and cuss when you spit
Know what I noticed? That tough shit is just when you spit
I couldn't picture you bustin' a clip
I could see you suckin' a dick or prolly getting' fucked with a stick
Drama with me, son, your baby momma will be
Found in the woods, hangin' by her thong from a tree
You spit my life and want an award
But you can't get my stripes 'cause you the type to run in a war
Slung jums in front of the store; done it before
Held guns, I'm talkin' at least a hundred or more
Should put a gun to your jaw, to one of your whores
Fuck under the covers; we all lovers under the floor"

From where they keep the four squeeze the four

We all going down for the motherfucking reaper law

Note Boom,Busdriver,Rap,"I was in a Hip Hop hair band, when I was watching 'Yo, MTV Raps'
Then I went to this CV shack... and I burned my unpublished books
And invented my young rugged looks, wrote a verse holding your CD rack
When I became a star, now girls show me their bikini wax
And shower me in vaginal secretions for no rational reason
Whatever happened to the undying purist's fuel? the young wistful rants?
The rap quiz bowl champ? now I go to afterparties where girls have
Good snatch and nipple clamps
I'm supposed to be protesting at a missile plant
I'm supposed to be casting an unpopular vote
Instead of basking in a sauna, in the water in a swim trunk
There's a skin chunk on my salad fork
There's an inconsistancy in my valid retort
You can dig in an underground t-shirt bin, but you're just
On the outside looking in
So I poured formaldehyde under your cooking skin
Because I'm from L.A., which means I'm a style snob
I can't imagine that there's any rapper who can put me out of a job
Because while they were reading 'Calvin and Hobbes' We filled [? ]
With lyrics and loops
But I'm not from your favorite group, put up your cypher circle's sacred hoop
Because I'm a hoola-hooper, bazooka-shooter, new recruiter
Of a daisy-dukes-wearing lone groupie
Astroglide and [? ] play a big part in my home movies
Because I'm a scene slut, you facetious fucks, if y'all don't make
Some noise I'll be applying for employment at Pizza Hut
Let's be level-headed, you can probably see through me
I'm the white man's character's nigger friend in the ethnocentric teen movie
Well? shut your mouth? just pay him for the green smoothie

Hold on- I'm still important. I was the clumsy co-author
Of your celebrated mantra for your movement
Then my felt pen turned into a cold spoon, and I want my love back
So I await a note boom

Want to see my live performance? No!
How about a [? ] verse? No!
Want an unedited television appearance? No!
Want to hear some exclusive tracks? No!

Damn, tough crowd. I thought they would always
Touch clouds when I bust styles, but what now?

What kind of name is Busdriver? Is it just a wack allegory?
And it can't be justified by any background story?
I heard he sucks live. only appeals to hipsters who
Dress like Russian spies, who are painfully cool and have button-eyes
A fan will squeeze a pint of fresh juice, and it'll discompose a recluse
But no childhood sex abuse can explain my terrible habits
That is why single is my marital status
That is why I'll happily take cash advances from charitable half-wits
And being that I'm from the Project Blowed I'm constantly probed
By the weak and the dull
With poor and boring things asked, I'll put a breech in the hole
Of their exploratory space craft with oratory weight mass, bleach for skulls
Because recent polls... a black rapper's viewed as a voyeuristic dunce
Who doesn't care about the B-Boyer's intrinsic hunch
And now indie music is instant lunch, at industry parties I piss in the punch
And won't take a business card, I have a disregard for life
I'm not on a mission to Mars or leave satellite-dish shards in the night

Hold on- I'm still important. I was the clumsy co-author
Of your celebrated mantra for your movement
Then my felt pen turned into a cold spoon, and I want my love back
So I await a note boom

Want to see my live performance? No!
How about a [? ] verse? No!
Want an unedited television appearance? No!
Want to hear some exclusive tracks? No!

Damn, tough crowd. I thought they would always
Touch clouds when I bust styles, but what now?

I thought they would always go buck wild, but now
They want a nigga with a plucked brow
Wow... tough crowd... the room is fucking loud"

Well, I've been gone but I'm back again
It's been to long, you wondering where I been
Well, I betcha I though I would pack it in
Since I got dissed on MTV for dear slim
Aw, man why'd y'all play me?
TRL, you drive me crazy!
Now everybody hates me!
I thought we were friends, Carson Daley?
So when I tried out for American Idol
I got up and sang for Simon Cowell
But he said I was 'absolutely horrible'
He said I was worse than William Hung, too
Now what do I do, please help me, could ya?
I keep getting punk'd like Ashton Kutcher
Since my names still bashed and butchered
But I was just changing, so listen would yah

Now I don't know if I'm past my prime
I'm feeling old, I just turned 29
It's crazy; I think I lost my mind
Cause lately it shows I forget my uh...
Sometimes I feel like my brain is missing
Sometimes I feel like Jessica Simpson
Don't know if tuna's fish or chicken
I told yah it's far to but know one would listen
Okay, you don't believe that it's true
Even my mom still thinks it's 52
Now I tried to explain but it's no use
At least the kids say 'man your cool, ha'
No, really man, I can't complain
Kids take puff paint and write my name
On their t-shirts and they be like WAH!
That's why it's time for me to change

Now I used to come through my system blasting
People couldn't miss it when I tried to pass them
In a Honda civic with the muffler dragging
Shoes off, hairy feet like Bilbo Baggins
Back when I was living wrong
I need to get tipsy like Jay Kwon
But know a days all I need is God
And a mic and a DJ and my i-pod
All righty put your dance shoes on
And everybody just get your groove on
We'll rock the party till the break of dawn
And even get your grandma to sing along
Now what I say, don't take this lightly
God runs things, not Bruce Almighty
He's Jesus, the only one I need

Nightmare,Josh Martinez,Rap,"I get into free styles like jams at the park
Giving out free samples of arguably art.
Imagine how I feel, sick of getting stuck in time.
Frozen but I'm supposing my grip slipped and now
It's nine minutes after nine and I'm a nervous wreck in line
To buy a book to look at the pictures. I can't read between the lines.

Late night insaniac, braniac dum dum.
In a mansion I'm a maniac, and then some.
I'm a miscreant, the photogenic kleptomaniac,
Outdoor enthusiast. It's the power punk rasta,
Eating tuna pasta on the daily laze about my day is hazy
Still from the night before.
I try and think up ways so that rap pays the bills
And still we never turn the heat on. Prefer to put a beat on
And warm up by drinking and rapping minds thinking rhyming
Couldn't get this good if you couldn't keep timing
That's why the r in rap stands stands for rhyming,
Little Boy! Little girls, c'mon all y'all gather round.

I was b-boying before you could do tricks,
Before you became hiphop you watched it on flicks.
Rented ideas indented in your brainstem
It's plain dem can't see the clouds for the rain
Or the crowds for the same faces that remain after the showcases
Standing out in front in the rain.


Woke up. Found out. Got told Broke down. Hold on
No sound smoke rings. Slow down (2x)
It's a nightmare where I can't wake up
It's right there and I can't pick it up...
You might stare, but I'd prefer that you wouldn't.
Again I reached my hand out to get it but couldn't.


You don't want it? Oh yes I Do.
And unless I get it soon, I really might lose it
I've done other people's dirty dishes to get here.
Get my drift are we clear yet? HA! Hear me!
Let no one tell ya wrong, long as there's blood in my lips
Flowing through my palms, I'mma string along my things and be gone.
I know songs I do get sung along to.
I roll with strong crew, and drink strong brew
You know my name's not Josh but call me that I like it better when you do.
Cause who I really am, man, I don't have a clue.
Let no one else hold down the god and all the odd jobs
I get up to in the middle of my garden
Yeah I got a credit card and run my own business
With the most talented valiant chicken eating rapscallions.
Tuna rice perogy washed down with a forty diet,
If it don't taste good, goddamn it man, fry it.
If you really want to know the truth you better try it on
Before you buy it and be gone.

If you want it bring it on. Me I'm already there.
I'm six foot two with light blond hair.
I'm where you wanna be when you're not on the internet
I live a life in analog but still get diggy with it.
Bit it from him hit it one time for breakdancing and two times for ballet dancers
I don't even listen to hiphop really, I like reggae. So, Control this.

I do it for love, money and anyone up above.
If you're out there, let me know. Show me love
'Cause I'm always looking when I walk side to side
Block to block it's too hot to not find shade and hide

Inside each hovel resides a harlequin novel
With Pablo Picasso's leftover absinthe bottle.
There were little green tears on the corner of his lips,
Which he licked to get lit on the dew drops and drips.
And as he slips into dreamstate...
The subtle rebuttal of utter sleeplessness sets in."
Calm Down,Joe Budden,Rap,"Calm down... calm down...

Moms use to tell me to... calm down...

Calm down...

(Budden Verse 1)
Look, I was such a lost soul, just wanted to be down with something
Look at your son now mommy I amounted to something
You couldn't figure out, what I had messed with the streets for
Cause you saw my genius without a SAT score
I took drugs and laced it with things
But you a addict yourself,
For you I was people, places and things (how the fuck you thought)
Angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
I tried to hide it, but Visine didn't always work
I needed someone to blame in my mind
I thought if you and dad never used dope I would a came out fine
And so I hit you hard when you threw in advice
Like what I want to talk to you about you ruined my life
You the reason why I ended up a con and I knew it
The reason I filled my body with that bombin' fluid, mommy
You the reason that my life's gone illegal
The reason I'm kinda different, don't think like normal people, not calm

She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up 'cause we gone make it

Listen... ain't shit like seeing your moms crying on the floor
Knowing you the reason why she ain't a'ight no more
But so young, I was like whatever
You use to chase me through the house with the knife like get your life together
Fucking drugs, how could I ever amp on you
And what made me think that I could lay my hands on you
I'm not surprised that you mad at me
Much as you hated my father, your youngest son is just like his daddy
Mommy I live life rude, how could you not understand it
On the same note I'm just like you
I got moms sensitivity, my fathers balls
His humor, his g, and my heart is yours
Fuck school, 'cause I had my major
Come to grips that it ain't so much the drugs, it's the addict behavior (no)
Was it the dick charge, the cut that came with it?
Wasn't really the smoking, but the rush that came with it (wasn't calm people)

She use to tell me to... calm down...
Calm down...
(But a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up 'cause we gone make it y'all
(Do it with me people) Calm down...
Calm down...
(Try to understand it) Baby just calm down...
(Those kind of things) Everything's gonna be all right
Calm down... (just bare with me for a... for a brief moment y'all)
Calm down...
Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up 'cause we gone make it y'all

(Budden Verse 3)
I felt so alone, I had a crew, but so what
Then when Angela stabbed me guess who showed up
And when people said I'd always be ill and twisted
And when the therapist had told us that the pills would fix it
Was sick of being sick, I was finally hurt
With all the praying that you did ma, it finally worked
God gave you a son back, I won't offend you again
Won't let the disease turn me against you again
Use to be high as ever, (but I) Joey Jr. got his life together
As a result, now we tighter than ever
So blessed, so grateful to be seeing tomorrow (see the whole world)
That's why I can't take a drink, not if even a swallow
I can't picture me twisted, like what I'm a do now
Haters I can't stop yet, my mothers to proud
Secure now, don't need to be down with nothing
Look at your son now mommy, I amounted to something
I'm so calm

Calm down...
Calm down...
(But a nigga wouldn't calm down) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up 'cause we gone make it y'all (hold up)
She use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) calm down...
(But I couldn't, I couldn't, couldn't do it) Baby just calm down...
(Nothing heals like time people) Everything's gonna be all right
(Understand that) calm down...
Calm down...
(Fucking miracle) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up 'cause we gone make it y'all

Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic

Brothers and sisters keep messing up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull

My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)

But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me

Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way

Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me

Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)

Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)

Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games

I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...

The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for
Are the answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be

Do like they do below the border.
Hmm? Speech's hair?

It's crowded plus they jerkin my space
Shouted 'cause they chase when I strut out
Sift through my block I'm c-cool
She's my mood to brace
Stole my mind back black
So what you play the boards
Skimmer we got butter so surfaces out
Clever, and I fix it for you, funk time is monk time
Slackers hit the bat, blackest fit my pack
And we for whatever
We get down in this pleasure heavy
And we are measured by the tens degrees of math
In a puzzle hand locked, clocked in struggle
Can't keep the three foot three above mec
In so depth I defect

(Ladybug and Doodlebug)
With my vanguard squad the gods in brooklyn

(Doodlebug)
And we troopin throught the fulton forkways
The eastern parkways
I'm broader than broadway, nothing more than morays
I sways, why 'cause I'm a brooklyn stroller
No one's cooler, pigs on my boulder
So I switch my pitch as I stretch down atlantic
Strictly slickly with my fork mean tactic
In fact it's really on the daily
Kids with guns and herbs look for herbs
Now I think you feel me
I freaks it, cause yo like my pimp stroll is cool
When I creeps up the sweet and jeeps blast
Tools rule the area, yo these fool don't play
I got the comrades of love, so the g stays

The place where I dwell is where the warriors dwell
Too many stories to tell
So on the block we don't talk
Stack of loot takin' propers
Might get a serious offer from a corrupt ass copper
So um, stop the nonsense
Brooklyn is the illest, the realest
Observe these words as I reveal this
Man my peoples out here they get down for this
Each one's a one man gang with a crown for this
Man burners to handle any business
And mad sneaky ways so ain't leavin' any witness
Got way more drama the theatrical lessons
So my suggestion, you come correct no question
'Cause if you comin' with that funny hot dog style
You might get looted, executed black mob style
From east new york back to ft. green
Brooklyns? classic mystical magic scene

(Butterfly)
We are plush like a millian bucks
Down every ave for like a zillion blocks
Blowin' out
With my nappy hoods down fulton
Blessin guess style limpin past the walt whitman
Steelo's changed on the corners we hang
The crime stoppers get mad with poppers and tens
And my scrambles ample kid, no part timin, just rhymin
In other words, I play these curbs, with j u ice
When they say you nice, I say son a little somethin'
Brooklyn's asphalt rolls like a syl keith rodeo
We big sound, down and gritty
Record and mic checkin', no question, this section of
New york city
Where the crooks lounge out, block powers found
Butterfly ground the sky favorite package of pound
It's like th-that, the beats know we be strappin 'em out
Mad moneys wish they g like us, clout
When I made the boogie I'm imported, I study chairman
Mao
Ain't nothin' but crooklyn in my plasma now
I got my g's behind the tongue of my gold high classics
I'm all city when I'm dip, if you want us you can find

My fancy
Up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
Never give a fuck how far Pi went
You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist

Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
Wookie foot must not sleep
Under the invaders
No batteries
No jumper cables

Wired underagers play box cutter facelift
Rock utter makeshift spirit
To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
And a bangin' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list

Walk for that
Metal train graf brainiac
Walk for them
Not a limelight
More to blush alizarin crimson
When the multi million
Tin men suck traditional rituals
Out the homes of starving children
And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
Dirty dub vamp.
Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser
Mars attacks colorfulness
I piss raptors on motherships

Hazy days will stay purple
Cause Cips with a Z bargain
Like Crazy Eddie commercials

Go Ah Ah Ah Ah
Network with a dirt devil
Burn train buffers.
Hi!
Cute the way your little parasol spins.
Bye!
Suck my Neanderthal dick.
Catapults spit.
Losing the screws and bolts
And all they heard's crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts
Zap!

Suicidal eye full of plastic nine.

These hoes don't love me, they love my benz, love my rims, love my style,
These fiends don't love me, they love my coke, love my dope, love my ink,
These haters don't love me, it don't matter to me, I stay hater free 'cause imma down ass g,
'Cause if I don't make dollars, then it don't make cents, if it don't make dollars, it don't make cents.

1st verse
I'm in town dog,
Mexican brown dog,
I'm signed to interscope,
I'm grims a c-note,
500 cokily add to a kilo,
Id rather be rich, than snitch nigga out cold,
My crack in sinthostat,
Drummers with hunny hats,
My bitch from d.r,
Switch 'em with bigger stash,
Movin my work, jus for some boots n a skirt,
I was loose but she complainin it hurt,
Ice skatin on ice,
I got these crack heads, scrapin the mic,
Late at night, bitch be shakin her dice,
Runnin' from feds, like I had jerry rice legs,
'Cause the dope and the rice come from pac and them plant eggs,
It's the top shotter that rocked prada, that rhymed proper,
In high school I had ex in my gym locker, locker, locker, locker.



2nd verse
I'm a sneaker addict,
Drug fanatic,
I live lavish,
Got more carots,
That bunny rabbits,
I plant 'marry I',
Courtyard groupie's lurkin,
An them niggas wit no pussy is always jerkin,
An niggas handcuff hoes like female cops,
I got ma wrists all froze, so the COs drop,
Ayo 'em drink malibu, dre drink henny, banks drink baileys and buck drink remi,
I'm on the 7 a glock like, I'm still smellin musty, leavin' barcelona for some argentina pussy,
Ye man g-unit stunts it ain't nothin', million dollar deals 'cause our fans dare hustle,
I stay stuntin, my glock stay pumpin, 58-58, I got my cell phone jumpin',
T-o-n-y the talk of new york, blowin' dro in the 6, on the way to court.

3rd verse
You in the CBA, I'm in the NBA, it's the rap t-mac, I stay with a gat,
Click clack, I sit back 'n' watch my soldiers attack, ya rhymes a snitches, homie I'm dealin' with fact,
Keep my car out the sun so the paint wont fade, n if my jewels don't shine its time to upgrade,
Imma ball till I fall, niggas can't ruin me, from platinum plaques, wall to wall jewellery, I love my style,
Hoes scream my name, its tony yayo, a cats scowl in the game, see niggas wanna kill me like sindy in scream, but I pack the mac-nilly wit a inferred beam, ayo I'm on daily like freddy in the dream, n my chains so heavy, it spotted to my splean, u front on my team, ma niggas will finish you, automatic traypound will fuckin' diminish you"
Tough,Kurtis Blow,Rap,"I don't want a lot, I want just enough
So why has it got to be so damn TOUGH

Livin' on the uptown side of jive
Hustlin' a buck to stay alive
Lookin' for a ten and they give your five
Well it's tough
You talk to the boss, the boss is gruff
You ask for a raise and they call your bluff
You may get some, but it's never enough
Because it's tough

[STRONG:] Like a magnum force
[ROUGH:] Like a new divorce
[MEAN:] Like a three-time loser
[BAD:] Like an L.A. cruiser
[DOWN:] Like a limousine
[BLIND:] Like a submarine
[HARD:] Like cold concrete
[TOUGH:] That's the rhythm of the beat

You hit the street and you look for work
You don't want to be some welfare jerk
But I wonder how you get to be Captain Kirk
It's tough
Now Kirk has a ship called the Enterprise
He cuts the aliens down to size
But I wonder what he'd do with the uptown guys
They're tough

Tough:
Try to get some cash
When you're looking for a raise and they give you trash

Rough:
When you got it like that
And your woman's running 'round with a baseball bat

HARD:
Try to play it cool when the girl's all know you're an out of work fool

Tough:
How it seems to be, wish I had somebody lookin' out for me

Try to find a lover if you dare
Even if you do she just won't care
Well no one ever said that that life is fair
Because it's tough
Saw a fine young lady the other day
I started my rap, I had a lot to say
But she said she was goin' with a C.P.A.
Now it's tough

[STRONG:] Like a superhero
[ROUGH:] Like a bank book zero
[MEAN:] Like the Oakland Raiders
[BAD:] Like the Caped Crusaders
[DOWN:] Like a homerun ball
[BLIND:] Like an umpire's call
[HARD:] Like a cruel deceit
[TOUGH:] That's the rhythm of the beat

You worked all year to buy a brand new car
A Coupe de Ville or a Jaguar
But you didn't make enough for a good cigar
Because it's tough
So you went to the bank to try to get a loan
But the guy behind the desk had a heart os stone
He said ""You don't need a car, use the telephone!""
It's tough

Tough:
It's a way of life, lost your job
Your money, but not your wife

Rough:
Gettin' in the black, Uncle Sam's in your pocket
And your woman's on your back

HARD:
That's the deal, had to get a loan just to buy a meal

Tough:
That's how it goes, when it's gettin' better, nobody knows

[STRONG:] Like Chocolate Thunder
[ROUGH:] Like Stevie Wonder
[MEAN:] Like Brucie The Shark
[BAD:] Like the Raider's Ark
[DOWN:] Like Sugar's Glove
[BLIND:] Like a man in love
[HARD:] Like a big defeat
TOUGH:That's the rhythm of the beat

[TOUGH:] That's the word, unemployment is all I heard
[ROUGH:] When you start your day, watch the finance man tow your car away

Damn we down ta the last supper
Gotta hustle
Feelin' my album shake the devil
Reconstruct this muthafucka
I never slowed down jus throwed down like I know how
But I do like she would have wanted me to do it
I still can't believe I lost her in the worst way
She died wearin my very first T-shirt on my birthday
Now what the fuck I'm s'posed ta celebrate
For the celebratin' bout ta gun his ass
But I got in my pad a little too late
Everybody got a role dey must play
No power wit da pray
But this muthafucka gotta pay
There be no frickin exscuse for what you done
Even ignored him when he started stealin from me
'Cause dem was crumbs
A rain drop to a river, huh
A sin to a christian
A holla to a whisper
She wuz the sole reason that I got along wit ya
But I'ma never heal from the scars of what you did to my sister
Murderer!

Rise,Redrama,Rap,"Blaming the man,
Blaming the gods
Nobody understands, you blaming the stars
Blaming yourself, hating yourself
Record exec blaming the sales,
Fat man blaming the scale are you aiming to bail,
Or aiming to rise?
Waiting to crawl away from it all or aiming to fly?
Wanna draw in sand, or paint in the sky? girl is your
Ass a six and a half, eight or a nine? then say it's a
Ten, then say it again I make music to feel free and
For paying the rent I was blaming the rules, blaming
The flu blaming my school then blaming the booze,
Probably blaming you too now your neighbours are blaming
You for banging the beat I can't blame them really it's
Invading the streets caught for bank robbery, blame the
Damned lottery I take the blame for a lot of things but
Not modesty

I got to rise up,
I got to, you got to, we got to
Get up, out, over yourself and get busy
Get up, out, over yourself and get busy

Man I'd have a lot of loot if they didn't download
And I need some auto-tune 'cause my record sound broke
Got a lot of obstacles, hard to get around though
Nothing is impossible, up for the next round so say it

If you hate it but save it if you brow nose play it or
Throw it away man but I'm proud though hate's a
Powerful thing, it brings you down bro hard to get
Ahead when moon-walking in sourdough I had it all well
Planned was king of the hill but it all fail bad was
Drinking my meals and missing a mil deal was tripping
On pills feel like smacking the mailman for bringing
The bills was blaming the rain and blaming the cold
Blaming the snow, blaming the yay, and blaming the yo
It ain't pretty but can't blame the city my eyes' on
Tomorrow I'm trying to stay witty

I got to rise up
I got to, you got to, we got to
Get up, out, over yourself and get busy
Get up, out, over yourself and get busy

When it all seems impossible
Let them know
What you gone do then rise or fall?
Let them know
Through the storm and the rain like ain't a thing
Let them know
Against all odds I came to win, yeah, I came to win

I got to rise up
I got to, you got to, we got to
Get up, out, over yourself and get busy
Get up, out, over yourself and get busy"

While you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my God, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage

So, so, so, so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button but yo
I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet

I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage

Whyyyyyyyyyyy!?

Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place

But make no mistakes and switch up my channel

Bad Man!,Murs,Rap,"(Intro: Murs)
Ready?

(9th Wonder)
Uh-huh

(Murs)
Aight...

After tonight
Don't leave your girl round me, heartbreaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up?, when we never broke down
And committed to each other, we was fuckin' around
That's how people get hurt, and we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and make things work
Or I could get behind you 'cause I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that, got a one track mind
But if you say you don't wanna fuck me too, then you lying
Tryna fight it girl, shit bring your ass here
Who else can make you wet by doin' this in your ear
(See why you playin', all that bullshit you sayin')

She got me screamin' in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the bitch do?, fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman, I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do shit
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie just to get into your pants
And ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
That happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak, it'll be to your benefit
A nigga you can fuck, and a nigga you can kick it with
I'm sick of this phone tag text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous, that's my forte
Let's go to my crib and have, sex in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

She said this might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first, had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers, I still got to charm her
I'ma tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Cam loose
Two months ago in Canada, ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly, look my bus cards are new
We'll shoot to my room, make the best out of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to ITunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
(So, here's my number, call me anytime girl)

Just because I'm a musician she must think I'm a (Bad Man!)
All alone when she listens and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention 'cause she thinks I'm a (Bad Man!)
It's not as bad as you think, 'cause you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a (Bad Man!)
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
Get that shit out your mind, I am not the (Bad Man!)

U Know What Time It Is (Extended Scratch Version),Grandmaster Flash,Rap,"(Music: j.saddler lyrics: l.dukes, g.williams - from the grandmaster flash album ""ba-dop-boom-bang"" elektra '87)

Just get off the wall, let's have a ball
The 70's are gone, it's the 80's y'all
Grab a fly girl by the hand and ask her to dance
C'mon fellas don't be shy, just take a chance
You'll never know it might lead to romance
Cause the beat is cold stompin', it'll put you in a trance
You're so hypnotized that you stop and stare
I'm steppin out of this 'cause I'm not with that there!
Get on the dancefloor c'mon take a stand
All the girlies in the place wanna dance with you my man
Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive, I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt, just go ahead and chase the skirt
You can't help it, it's your line of work
To get women on the floor
It's you they adore, you might as well

You know what time it is

Hang on party people cause here we go
We're gonna cold take the party to another plateau
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We wanna hear flash cut the beat up, ain't that right
While flash is choppin the mix like an ax on wood
You gotta dance cause the beat is finger lickin' good


Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's anything you want to say, say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And y'all are lettin me know we're cold blowin' the rim
That's right, you're being served, served with a smile
And homeboy you don't like it, we can step in the aisle
Just show no shame, you know it's only right
And if there's anything you want to get off, get it off tonight

A simple puch of the fade, a little flex of the wrist
Flash whoopin the mix while I'm kickin the gift
Yo like a double edge razor, the boy is nice
When he cuts, give him room, or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold, to hot to be stopped
This jam that we got is good to the last drop
Weather you like it or not, we rock
Yo since the day we emerged, have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo' this is word
This party's rated ns for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop, hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild
But as you know there's always one in the crowd
You wanna party, then act like you know, can you dig it
And if you came to get ill, forget it, I ain't with it"
Runaway,Manafest,Rap,"It's funny I never thought that I'd be homeless
I used to walk by them, now I'm living on the corners
Stretching for a touch of a hand, a dollar bill or a chance
Give me your sandwich bag, man I'll do anything
With thoughts of desperation my hearts racing
I'm not star gazing I could die of starvation
Hallucinated from the day's wasted
Lost track of time while my mind aging
People looking at me like a lost patient
Like I'm already dead why they all hating
Did I choose this life, or life choose me
I ran away at sweet 16 mommy do you miss me, this is Krissy


So I run, and I run, and I ran and I ran praying maybe some day we meet again
Cause It hurts when you hurt, and I hurt and I feel, like I'm healed can we all just make a mends
I run and I run and I run, and I run


Good bye to the world, good bye to my girl
Say hello to my home the street corner
Its absurd every word that was spoken
It must come alive cause my life is still broken
Wondering did I miss it, what mistake did I make? Can I fix it?
These streets of gone ballistic
This isn't what I thought it would be, where's daddy
Is he still mad at me, I wonder would he have me
Back in the home, back in the zone, back where I can't eat
Where's there's heat and use a phone
Cause it hurts and I know I never said good bye
I ran away I thought like anything I could fly


Mom and dad are you there, are you listening
I want to come home, but scared of the mess I'm in
Please forgive me of the things I committed
Against you against me, our family tree
And I know we haven't spoke in so long, I was so wrong
To think I could live on, on my own accord
I'm a take the train home, but I need to know
If you'll welcome me back through your life's door?
Show me a sign with a red ribbon, hang one on the side of the train building
And if I see it than I'll know that your still willing,
And if not I won't ever call or visit
I'll pretend that I'm re-living the beginning,
Like when we used talk in the kitchen, without all the fights & friction
This is me wishing, one of your ex children
Picturing praying that you got the same feelings,
I'm running"
Locked Up,Akon,Rap,"I'm steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't gettin' no closer
No matter how far I go

And I get locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no

Headin' up town to Rio, back with a couple keys
The corner block's on fire, undercovers dressed as fiends
Makin' so much money
Product's movin' fast
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

They won't let me out

Visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is gettin' empty
My cellmates gettin' food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life

Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out

They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out

I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
They won't let me out

Maybe a visit, send me some magazines
Send me some money orders, maybe a visit baby
'Cause I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer?
I'm locked up
Get me out of here
Baby I'm locked up

Tell them I'm locked up

I need a down ass chick, that'll roll wit the clique
For the dope sale, bank robbin, cock it back and buck up on a bitch
Kidnap vamp, leave a busters body, in a ditch
Take the charge for you, always drinking liquor
Stayin lit, when we in the bed, baby girl can ride
Like a champ, give a playa head, lickin' on my thang
Like a stamp, if I had that I wouldn't trade anything
For her she my main girl, main dog, that's my main whore

Now I can't say that I love her, but I got some love for her
She showed me, she was 'bout a haul before I really knowed her
I schooled her 'bout them glocks, I schooled her 'bout them rocks
I told her how to hold a spot when I was off the block
She kept it hot, as soon as I stepped in the house she had my money spot
Plus a dro blunt rolled up with a syrup lollipop
The hood tried to holler everyday but it ain't nothin'
She down with the King but I still love a ghetto ass chick

This for when you took the charge when I committed the crime
I was out there super high playin' mister crash dummy
You put up all my money, didn't take nothing from me
Always found your boy a lawyer when I caught me a case
Paid all my fines and kept up with my court dates
And even though I gave you hell with these other lil broads
You always came and made my bail when I broke the law
The only one that's reliable the one that's dependable
Keep you by my side these other fools is suspendable
I ain't forgot when I was out there hurtin' for some cash
You never mind takin' your last, on out the stash
Always tried to give me the last up out your purse
Always tried to get my ass to go on and go to church
I couldn't pay you back even if I had to
Hard on these fools but I'll never be to hard on you"

Man, check this out- it was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick, right?
Hey. He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'?
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said,
Woo, good morning, ladies.
You like that shit, man? Hey, man, I got a gang of that shit, man.
I tell you what- my man on the guitar, fool on the drums,
Everybody just crowd around the mic, I'll tell you all these mutha-fuckin' jokes.
But first, I'ma start it off like this. Hey, help me sing it, homeboy.)
Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.
So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems.
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims.
So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville.
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my caddy will.

Well it was just sundown in a small white town. They call it Eastside Palmdale.
When the Afroman walked through the white land, houses went up for sale.
Well, I was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cds when I met a little girl named Jan.
I let her ride in my Caddy 'cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan.
We fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro.
Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right. She sucked my dick till the shit turned white.
I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a ZEBRA!
I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way, until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet.
I ran. I jumped out the back window, but her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4.
Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night.
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy I ever had.
I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time.

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.

I met this lady in Hollywood. She had green hair, but damn she looked good.
I took her to my house, 'cause she was fine, but she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine.
I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African.
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice. I ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice.
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia.
Had a big butt and big titties, too, so I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo.
See, I met this woman from Hawaii. Stuck it in her ass, and she said, Aiiiiieeee!
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch.
Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky. She said, I'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me.
I came in her mouth. It was a crisis. I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices.

Hey, wait a minute man, check this out.

I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee. Her titties were filled with Hennesy.
That country music nearly drove me crazy, but I rode that ass and said, Yes, Miss Daisy!
Met this lady in Oklahoma; put that pussy in a coma.
Met this lady in Michigan; I can't wait till I fuck that bitch again.
Met a real black girl in South Carolina; fucked her till she turned into a white albino.
Fucked this hooker in Iowa. I fucked her on credit, so I owe her.
Fucked this girl, down in Georgia; came in her mouth. Man, I thought I told ya.
Met this beautiful sexy ho; she just ran cross the border of Mexico.
Fine young thing, said her name's Maria. I wrapped her up just like a Hot Tortilla.
I wanna get married, but I can't afford it. I know I'ma cry when she gets deported.

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.

Have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck, but the pussy just ain't no good? (SAY WHAT?)
And then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet, plus you in the wrong neighborhood?
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy, but it takes her so long to come (SAY WHAT?)
Then a dude walks in. That's her big boyfriend, and he asks you where you from? (Where you from, man?)
So you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (I don't bang.), you start talkin' real fast.
But he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife, so he starts beatin' on your ass.
Now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft. (WHUT?)
You thought you had a girl to rock your world, now you still gotta go jack off.

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.

Jacob's Ladder,Incognito,Jazz,Instrumental
Slow Like Honey,Jane Monheit,Jazz,"You moved like honey in my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires were burning
You came near to me and you endeared to me
But you couldn't quite discern me

Does that scare you? I'll let you run away
But your heart will not oblige you
You'll remember me like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you

And my big secret - Gonna win you over
Slow like honey, heavy with mood

I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze
And you'll wonder what it is about me

It's my big secret - Keeping you coming
Slow like honey, heavy with mood

Though dreams can be deceiving
Like faces are to hearts

They serve for sweet relieving
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart

So I stretch myself across, like a bridge
And I pull you to the edge
And stand there waiting
Trying to attain
The end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you?
Must I release you?
As I rise to meet my glory

But my big secret
Gonna hover over your life
Gonna keep you reaching
When I'm gone like yesterday
When I'm high like heaven
When I'm strong like music
Cause I'm slow like honey, and
Heavy with mood"
Easy To Love,Charlie Parker,Jazz,"Danny was an old-time Bourbon Street barker
Who wanted the same as Charlie Parker
And always cued-up a ball
Thinking he was one rack away
But even when you run the table
The check still seems small
When it's your last payday

The shallow pocket changer
Who always took advantage of strangers
Tried to make a five-grand grab
With a split second getaway
But he forgot that a bag of money
Ain't worth much on a slab
When it's your last payday

That line about luck just can't be bought
You're always lucky 'til you get caught
Trouble will find you, no need to look
And luck won't help when they close the book

I know a lot of young fellas in here
Especially those on the highest tier
Still want to believe
That Santa comes in a sleigh
They're right about the long white beard
But wrong about Christmas Eve
What's Christmas, when it's your last payday"
The man i love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
That's meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love"
So What,Miles Davis Quintet,Jazz,Instrumental
Georgia On My Mind,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind, Georgia on my mind
Each day, Georgia my honey, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you, to you beautiful Georgia
Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind"
Kicking The Gong Around,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"It was down in Chinatown
All the cokies laid around
Some were high and some were mighty low
There were millions on the floor
When a knock came on the door
And there stood old Smoky Joe

He was sweatin', cold and pale
He was lookin' for his frail
He was broke and all his junk ran out
Nobody made a sound
As he stood and looked around
And then you hear old Smoky shout

""Tell me where is Minnie?
My poor Minnie!
Has she been here
Kicking the gong around?""

""If you don't know Minnie
She's tall and skinny
She gets her pleasure
Kicking the gong around!""

""Just tell her Smoky Joe
Was here and had to go""
And as he departed
The curtains parted
And there stood Minnie
Kicking the gong around

""Just tell her Smoky Joe
Was here and had to go""
And as he departed
The curtains parted
And there stood Minnie
Kicking the gong around"
Isn't This A Lovely Day?,Diana Krall,Jazz,"The weather is fright'ning
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's O.K.

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh!
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Tho' we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter

If the skies are gray
As long as I can be with you it's a lovely day

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh!
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Tho' we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
As long as I can be with you
As long as I can be with you
As long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day"
I've Tried And I've Waited,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"I've tried
And I've waited so long
They say patience and will
Make you strong
But I've wanted and wished for it
Longed for it prayed for it;
The scent of the innocent.

Each time
I walked through that door
Hoping to see
What I'm for
I ironed my shirt and I polished my shoes
And I kissed all the feet of the world

Show me the times when I fail
Give me the strength to be frail
To ask and receive
To trust when in need
When I've tried and I've waited so long

I've tried and I've waited so long"
My Love Is,Diana Krall,Jazz,"My love, my love is a mountainside
So firm, So firm it can calm the tide
My love for you is a mountainside
It stands so firm it can calm the tide
That's why my love,
My love is a mountainside

My love, my love is an ocean's roar
So strong, so strong that I can't let you go
My love for you is an ocean's roar
It's grown so strong that I can't let you go
That's why my love, my love is
An ocean's roar

My love is longer than forever
And endless as the march of time
Till ninety-nine years after never
In my heart you'll still be mine
Because my love

My love is a deep blue sea
So deep, so deep that I'll never be free
My love for you is a deep blue sea
It's grown so strong that I'll never be free
That's why my love
My love is a deep blue sea"
I'm Coming Through,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I looked down at a sparkling band
And only saw my Mother's hand
The things I've earned
They never came too cheap
But then the likeness only goes so deep

As clouds approach the facing shore
And although two pairs of shoes sit by the door
I can't pretend I don't descend
I know I should be joyful now
But time means nothing
Only the love you gave to me can save me
I think she knew

I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now
I'm coming through

I looked down at a twist of lace
And only saw my Father's face
The things we shared
Have hurt us both so much sometimes
We each go places love can't touch

A calendar marks days to keep
The moon shone down
Upon chill waters running deep
The veil so thin that light poured in
The sight was so astonishing
That time meant nothing
Only a kiss that felt like this cloud move me
I think she knew

I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now
I'm coming through"
Battle Hymn Of The Republic,Gene Harris,Jazz,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never sound retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat
Oh, be swift my soul to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet
For my God is marching on

Everyday I sing glory, glory, hallelujah
Everyday, glory, glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
For my God is marching on
Marching on, marching on, marching on

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free
While God is march, He's marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on"
I've Got the World on a String,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"I've got the world on a string
Sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rainbow
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love?

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
Sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, mama, I'm in love

Oh, what a world, what a life
Baby, I'm in love, is it?
Looka here, lucky me, can't you see
Mama, I'm in love?

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go, yes

What a world, what a, what a life
Baby, love
Oh, what a world baby
Oh, I'm in love, yeah man"
In The Dark,Nina Simone,Jazz,"In the dark it's just you and I
Not a sound, there's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark

Now, in the dark, in the dark
I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark

But soon this dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun, fun to be kissed

In the dark, now we will find
What the rest have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
Lord, in the dark"
Come On Everybody (Get Down),Us3,Jazz,"Come on everybody, come in here and swing
Everybody come on everybody, come in here and swing

Move to a rhythm that's smooth, made to groove
Work that body baby it's a party
Shake it, funky ain't it?
Yeah, the long awaited return of fluent movement-enhanced music
Ain't nothin' but to do it
Manoeuvre to a sound that's makin' you wanna dance to it
Nod ya head, clap ya hands and shake that ass to it
Hit the floor, it's yours, assuming that's what ya came here for
Why play the wall'n'all
The flavour's so raw get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

Bounce to a piece that got the spot hoppin'
Bottom to top, top to bottom
Form, a bit of a break from the norm
Converge with a melodic surge and get ya groove on
Amplify the vibe supplied on your hi-fi
Level the bass to coincide with the highs then rise
Partake in a rhythm created to elevate you to a point only we can take you
Notes arranged, grooves interchange
Engage with flav givin' ya what ya crave
Praise the MC that's lacin' ya party
Maintain, do ya dance and don't hurt nobody
As I see bodies bouncing constantly
Ears consume the bom diggy till ya city bound
Get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

Get loose, feel the groove cruise, on a bassline ooze
Sweat drips as the hips of ladies gyrate and the fellas go crazy
What more could ya ask for in a joint that's packin' the floor
Plus a rapper type raw
Define the aspect of rhyme orated
Think how long ya waited to get blessed with innovative style
Providing your motivation
The duration of a jam that sounds so amazing
Cave in get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down"
Bitch,Room Eleven,Jazz,"I hate the world today,
You're so good to me I know,
But I can't change.
Try to tell you but you look at me like maybe I'm a angel underneath,
Innocent, sweet...

Yesterday I cried,
Must have been releaved to see the softer side.
I can understand how you feel so confused, I don't envy you.
I'm a little bit of everything, all grown into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother,
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed.
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, nothing in between.
You know you wouldn't want it any other way.

So take me as I am,
This may mean you have to be a stronger man.

Was to sure that when I start to make you nervous and go into extremes.
Tomorrow I will change, today wont mean a thing.

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother,
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed.
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, nothing in between.
You know you wouldn't want it any other way.

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, child,
I'm a mother, sinner, saint,
I do not feel ashamed.
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, nothing in between.
U know you wouldn't want it any other way no."
Need Some More,The Brand New Heavies,Jazz,"I been singing on your radio
And then you'll see me on your video
'Cause here we are
I know some people come and go
But we're here to stay
And we're gonna rock your show
We're souls promoting music from the heart
We've been keeping it real from the start
Love's almost gone
From the industry where we belong
But your appreciation keeps us strong

Oh, we're so hungry for music
Food for the soul should be our goal
'Cause we're so hungry for something

I need some more
Do du do more
Do du do
Give me some more
Do du do more
Come on baby won't you play?

Don't be manipulated by industry
Telling you how music's supposed to be
'Cause it's a game plyed by those who love celebrity
And that's not what music supposed to be
Al Green, Sam Cook and Donnie Hathaway
Try finding stations where these songs are played
Did we forget to see variety is still the spice
That brightens up even your dullest life?

See this here this collaboration
Is a Heavies and Russo situation
So listen up y'all who fail to introduce
The uh talent that we can produce"
My Funny Valentine,Gerry Mulligan Quartet,Jazz,"You're my funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographical
Yet you're my favourite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smiling?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day

Each day is Valentine's Day"
When I Grow Too Old To Dream,Diana Krall,Jazz,"When I grow too old to dream, I will have you to remember.
When I grow too old to dream, your love will live in my heart.
So kiss me my sweet, and so let us part.
When I grow too old to dream, your love will live in my heart.

When I grow, when I grow too old to dream, I will have you to remember.
When I grow, when I grow too old to dream
Your love will live, will live in my heart.
So kiss me, my sweet, and so let us part.
When I grow, when I grow too old
Sh-do-ya-do-ya-do-ya to dream! Your love will live in my heart.

So kiss me my sweet! And so let us part
When I grow too old to dream, your love will live in my heart"
I've Got You Under My Skin,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so not to give in
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats - how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality - step up, wake up to reality?
But each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you under my skin"
Easy Game,Jazzamor,Jazz,"(Roland grosch, bettina mischke)

Hey balou where do you go
To the river that's running slow
I'm your girl and I'm not ashamed
'Cause I know love is only a game
No no no no no easy game

No no no easy game no no no
No no no no easy game no no no

Hey balou you're running fast
With goose steps out of the past
Can't you see wherever we aim
That love is not an easy game
No no no no no easy game

No no no easy game no no no
No no no no easy game no no no

Where do you go what do you know
Who knows how this story ends"
Let Yourself Go,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So:

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""No, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go"
Dance me love,Silje Nergaard,Jazz,"Your weak afterglow
Can't warm a heart in sorrow
The spark that is left behind
Can't light a troubled mind

Your fire I know
Can warm those bleak tomorrows
The dark must not enter in
So let the dance begin

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark

We move to and fro
We beg or steal or borrow
A love that can fan the spark
And help us face the dark

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance, my love
Dance me through the dark

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance, my love
Dance me through the dark

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance, my love
Dance me through the dark
Dance me through the dark"
Stranger In Paradise,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"Take my hand, 
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed, 
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside 
An angel like you
I saw your face, 
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended 
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms 
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"
Stranger in Paradise,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"Take my hand,

The Lady Is A Tramp,Queen Latifah,Jazz,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew
And never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too
From Maine to Albuquerque

Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball
And what is twice as sad
I was never at a party
Where they honored Noel Ca'ad

But social circles spin too fast for me
My 'Hobohemia' is the place to be

I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care, I'm broke, it's o'k
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I love the rowing on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose? I'm flat, that's that
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp"
My Last Affair,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair

Tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair

Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair

I say, tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair

This is my last affair"
Pick Yourself Up,Dianne Reeves,Jazz,"(Jerome Kern, Dorothy Fields)

Pick yourself up...
Take a deep breath...
Dust yourself off
And start all over again.

Nothing's impossible, I have found
For when my chin is on the ground.
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off
And start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence
If you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off
And start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired
Until the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son.

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again
They picked themselves up
Dust themselves off
And start'd all over again.

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son.

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath...
Pick yourself up...
Dust yourself off
And start all over again."
Nobody,Nina Simone,Jazz,"When life seems full of clouds and rain
I am filled with an awkward pain
Who soothes my achin', thumpin' brain?
- Nobody

When winter comes with snow and sleet
I'm so tired with cold feet
Who says: ""Here's two bits Nina honey, go and eat?""
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get me somethin', yes, from somebody, sometime
Well, I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, no time

Now when winter comes all cool and clear
My friends they see me comin' near
Who says: ""Come on in child and have a beer?""
- Nobody

When all day long things go amiss
I go home to find some bliss
Who hands to me a glowing kiss?
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from no body - no time
And until I get me somethin', from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, nobody, no time, no time, no body, no time!"
My Foolish Heart,Billy Eckstine,Jazz,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart

But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart"
Angeline,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"Robins in the tree tops high
Soon will sing a lullaby, Angeline
Angeline

Bashful little whippoorwills
Can't you hear them say ""I will"" 
Angeline
Angeline

The crickets in the meadows
The dear in the woods
Know it's time for singin' in the rain
Until you make up your mind I'll try to be good babe
How long mush I wait
Can't you see my heart's a flame
Don't you know that you're to blame
Say you're mine, Angeline,
Angeline 

Oh. Angeline
Sweet Angeline
Oh baby, I love ya Angeline"
You Are There,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"In the evening, when the kettle's on for tea
An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see
And I believe that you are there

In a garden, when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petals soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

When I'm dreaming
And I find myself awake
Without a warning
And I rub my eyes
And fantasize
And all at once I realize
It's morning
And my fantasy is fading
Like a distant star at dawn
My dearest dream is gone
I often think
There's just one thing to do
Pretend the dream is true
And tell myself that you are there"
Family Reunion,George Benson,Jazz,"Girl
Ooh
Oh, baby

Morning, noon, and night, I'm thinkin' about you
Things just ain't been right since you've been gone
Till the end of time we've taken a vow to
Keep our family strong
But we were both tryin' to grow in our own direction
Soon the magic of two meant nothing at all

So don't you think it's 'bout time (It's 'bout time)
We had a family reunion (Make things right)
'Cause I'm losin' my mind (All my mind)
Without you here in my life (In my life)

Tell me what you want, let's get it together
No more wastin' time on what we're not
You and I should love each other forever
Family means a lot
So baby, let's make a move, find a new beginning
Set your feelin' the same way I feel tonight

Come on and give it a try (One more try)
Let's have a family reunion (Make things right)

Not havin' you by my side (By my side)

We had a family reunion (Make things right)
Because I'm losin' my mind (All my mind)
Without you here in my life (In my life)

And now that we've been through everything, we don't have to worry
Let's put the pain of the past behind
And girl I promise you that love will always stay in our lives

So don't you think it's 'bout time (It's 'bout time)
We had a family reunion (Make things right)
Because I'm losin' my mind (I'm losin' my mind, baby)
Without you here in my life (Here in my life)

Come on and give it a try (Yeah, girl)
Let's have a family reunion (A family reunion)
You know it's a crime (You know it's a crime, baby)

Old Devil Moon,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the sky
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I just wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love

I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

Blinds me with love"
Embraceable you,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"George and Ira Gershwin

Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
My irreplaceable you
Just to look at you
My heart grows tipsy in me
You and you alone

Bring out the gypsy in me

The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be naughty baby
Come to me
Come to me do
My sweet embraceable you

I Can Tell,Al Di Meola,Jazz,"I can tell
You are the one and know I can be sure
When lies are real it hurts a little more
I could show you why I'll see right through your eyes

East Of The Sun,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"East of the sun (babe, in the brightness)
And west of the moon (we'll be diggin' a glow)
We'll build a dream house (a righteous pad)
So lovely (where you can really lay it on me)

Near to the sun in the day (we'll be jumpin')
Near to the moon at night (you'll be with me)
We'll live in a lovely way dear (solid duty, I'm hip)
Living our love in pale moonlight (you're mellow)

Just you and I (we'll nix the squares)
Forever and a day (so long, so long)
Love will not die (we're together forever)
We'll keep it that way (forever)

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
(On a June night, kiiss me and hold tight forever)
East of the sun and west of the moon
(Well, alright then, take 'em, buddy)"
Hit The Ground,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Hit the ground, baby
It's all right now
Hit the ground, baby
Take your veil down

See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground, baby,
'Cause I want to love you now

Hit the ground, baby
I said it's all right now
Hit the ground, baby
You're gonna make it somehow

Baby, why so lonely?

Hit the ground baby
Hit the ground and run

See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground, baby
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground, baby
Hit the ground and run"
Just Another Parade,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"Yesterday's news is tomorrow's blues...
But today I am alive (I am alive)
Today I did much more than survive

I learned to live by the love I give
It's the only thing I own
Shadowed valleys that I've known helped me build my home

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should you be afraid?)
We've seen better, we've seen darker days
So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should you be so afraid?)
Sittin' here watching just another parade

...Just another parade...

Summer will end, then the death begins
Grandma's hands are moving slow
She takes the time to let me know winter's winds will blow
Will blow...

She said look at your sun, he's a golden one...
Makes you turn your pages slow
Is life more precious than we know?
Every day unfolds (every day)

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should you be so afraid?)
I've seen brighter, seen darker days
So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should I be so afraid?)
Sittin' here watching... it's just another parade

Just another parade... just another parade... just another parade

So tell me why
Why are you so afraid?
Why should I be afraid?
When you know we've seen brighter, we'veseen darker days
So tell me why: why should I be afraid? Why should you be afraid?
Sittin' here watchin... it's just another parade
Tell me why should I be afraid?
I've seen better... I've seen darker days
Tell me why... why should I be afraid?
Sittin' here watchin... it's just another parade"
Good Love,Incognito,Jazz,"If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cause there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions and promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done
If you insist on making life a compromise
You're gonna wake up to find your world has come undone
All the right intentions and promises are never enough
And soon you find it all gone

Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

Good love, precious and gifted
Can't stand waitin' forever
Good love, no greater feelin'
No one could ever deny
Stop wastin' all the good love

You're takin' your time comin' to let me know
Now you better decide 'cause there's a limit to your games
Let your intuition lead you on
Follow the signs to the place you belong
If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cause there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions and promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done

Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

Don't go wastin' good love
Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

Lean On Me,Gene Harris,Jazz,"Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if, if we are wise
We know that there's 
Always tomorrow

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need 
Somebody to lean on

Please, swallow your pride
If I have things 
That you need to borrow
No one, no one can fill 
Those of your needs
That you won't let show

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need

We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, Gene

Now just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need

Somebody to lean on
Need somebody 
Just wanna lean on you
You can lean on me

Want somebody to
Someone, someone

I Wished On the Moon,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you"
White Christmas,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)
And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)
And may all your christmases be
(All your christmases be white)
(All your christmases be white)"
Lover,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Lover, when I'm near you and I hear you speak my name
Softly, in my ear, you breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

(Instrumental bridge)

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When two lips of coral want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart"
Lilac Wine,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because I brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love..."
Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me,Robbie Williams,Jazz,"Do nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head

Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
That doesn't mean I've been untrue?
While we're apart, all the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will

True, I've been seen with someone new
That don't mean I've been untrue?
While we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Baby you never will

That's the truth I'm a liar
And don't tell your mama"

Surrey With The Fringe On Top,Miles Davis Quintet,Jazz,Instrumental
I'll Look Around,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I'll look around until I've found
Someone who laughs like you

I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear
I look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Won't be the old love I always knew"
Gloomy Sunday,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Sunday is gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday.

Gloomy is Sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let then know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday."
He Ain't Got Rhythm,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"'Cause he ain't got rhythm
Every night he sits in the house alone
He ain't got rhythm
Every night he sats there are wears a frown
He attracted some attention
When he found the fourth dimension
But he ain't got rhythm
So no one's with him
The loneliest man in town

Oh! lonely man is he
Bending over his books
His wife and family
Keep giving him dirty looks
'Cause he ain't got rhythm
When they call him up
It's to call him down
With that daring aviator
He encircled the equator
But he ain't got rhythm
So no one's with him
Loneliest man in town"
Over The Rainbow,Judy Garland,Jazz,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?"
Lover Come Back To Me,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?

You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am so lonely

The sky was blue, the night was cold
The moon was new but love was old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

Oh, I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am so lonely

Oh, the sky was blue, the night was cold
The moon was new but love was old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

Lover, lover, come back, lover, come back

Lover, come back, lover, come back, lover, come back
Lover, come back, lover, come back, lover, come back
Lover, come back, lover, come back to me

Lover, come back, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Lover, come, lover, come, lover, come back"
The Lady With The Fan,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"She's the lady with the fan
When she comes by, hold your man
She made Smoky Joe so ginny
He forgot about his Minnie
She's the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan
Can she dance? Yeah, man!
Every wiggle gets a giggle
From the hick who pays a nickel
To see the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan
She's the lady with the fan
She's such a grand attraction
She put lazy-bones in action
She's the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan
She's the lady with the fan
In fair or stormy weather
She shakes them both together
She's the lady with the fan!"
If I Didn't Care,Ink Spots,Jazz,"If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
Darlin' if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?

Day By Day,Eliane Elias,Jazz,"Day by day, I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone and I'm in love to stay

Summer Song,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Love, to me, is like a summer day
Silent 'cause, there's just too much to say
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Even clouds that may drift by
Can't disturb our summer sky

I'll take summer, that's my time of year
Winter's shadow, seems to disappear
Gay is swanee season
That's the reason I can say
That I love a summer day

I hear laughter, from the swimming hole
Kids out fishin', with the willow pole
Boats come driftin', round the bend
Why must summer, ever end...

Love, to me, is like a summer day
If it ends, the memories will stay
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Now the days are getting long
I can sing my summer song

I hear laughter, from the swimmin' hole
Kids out fishin', with the willow pole
Boats come driftin', round the bend
Why must summer, ever end...

Oh, love to me, is like a summer's day
If it ends, the memories will stay
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Now the days are getting long
I can sing, my summer song..."
Ill Wind (You're Blowin' Me No Good),Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Blow ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)

Go ill wind, go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood, and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today

You're blowin' me no good (no good)

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)

Blow, ill wind, blow"
Meditation,Astrud Gilberto,Jazz,"In my loneliness
When you're gone
And I'm all by myself
And I need your carress
I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just think of you
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes I love you so
And that for me 
Is all I need to know

I will wait for you
Till the sun falls
From out of the sky
For, what else can I do
I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me"
Sleigh Ride,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling, too

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

You Go To My Head,Gabriela Anders,Jazz,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning around in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a zip of a good sparkling wine
And your smile makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head
Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head

You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning around in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
I only hope I can make you mine
You go to my head, you go to my head

You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
I only hope I can make you mine
You go to my head, you go to my head, go to my head

(Incomprehensible)
Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head
Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head

You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
But only hope I can make you mine
You go to my head, you go to my head
You go to my head

I can make you mine
I can make you mine
You go to my head
And like the bubbles of champagne"
This Time The Dream's On Me,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Somewhere, someday
We'll be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way
This time the dream's on me

You take my hand
And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me"
Snowfall,The Manhattan Transfer,Jazz,"Snowfall
Softly
Gently drift down

Snowflakes
Whisper
'Neath my window

Covering trees
Misty lights
Velvet breeze
'Round my doorstep

Gently
Softly
Silent
Snowfall

Covering trees
Misty lights
Velvet breezes
'Neath my window

Gently
And softly
Silent
Snowfall

Drift down
Drift down
Drift down

The Girl from Ipanema,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Tall and tan
And young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema
Goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes
Ooh
When she walks
She's like a samba
That swings so cool
And sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes
Ooh
Oh
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her
I love her?
Yes
I would give
My heart gladly
But each day
When she walks
To the sea
She looks
Straight ahead
Not at me

Tall and tan
And young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema
Goes walking
And when she passes
I smile
But she doesn't see

(Ooh)
Oh
But I watch her
So sadly
How can I tell her
I love her?
Yes
I would give
My heart gladly
But each day
When she walks
To the sea

Straight ahead
Not at me

Bewitched,Laura Fygi,Jazz,"He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a week
Since this half pint imitation's
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
Until love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Oh, I lost my heart but what of it
He is cold, I agree
Oh, but he can laugh and I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I"
All Clear,George Benson,Jazz,Instrumental
Spirits Up Above,Jose James,Jazz,"There's a girl that I once knew
Who often had a friend a friend or two
She gave them time love of wit and rhyme
Sublime

They would come from far away
And often gather there all day
To show their love
And see which one would stay

But to her it mattered not
For loyalty was not her lot
Her answer was for not for them
To know

There she goes on her marry way
Though she's only queen for a day
Boy and girl often take this world
So you better mind what you say

My advice to you my friend
Is try to find what it's about
And then you take into account your own

Don't you take some sugar in your mouth
That may be sweet to you
But bitter when you feel it later on

What is good for you may not be good for me
So different strokes
For different folks
Could be a real good rule

There she goes on her marry way
Though she's only queen for a day
Boy and girl often take this world
So you better mind what you say

There she goes on her marry way
Though she's only queen for a day
Boy and girl often take this world
So you better mind what you say

There's a girl that I once knew
Who often had a friend a friend or two
She gave them time love of wit and rhyme

They would come from far away
And often gather there all day
To show their love
And see which one would stay

But to her it mattered not
For loyalty was not her lot
Her answer was for not for them
To know"
Skylark,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me
Won't you tell me where my love can be
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there

Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there"
The Best Thing For You,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I only want what's the best thing for you
And the best thing for you would be me
I've been convinced
After thinking it through that the best thing for you would be me

Everyday to myself I'd say point the way
What would it be?
I ask myself what's the best thing for you
And myself and I seem to agree
That the best thing for you would be me"
Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me, honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone"
Willow Weep For Me,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
Gone my lovely dreams
Lovely summer dreams
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears along the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a sign
And crying alone
Murmur to the night
Hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing
Crying all alone
Weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to me plead
Hear me willow and weep for me
Willow
Willow
Weep for me"
Like Young,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I'm out doin' the usual places
And I'm livin' it, like young
Then I dig me this face of all faces
He's the craziest, like young

He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
He reads Kerouac, like young
He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

We start blowin' the pad around lovin'
And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven
And he's reachin' me, like wow

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
If he were to brush me and go
I'm starting to wear my hair again
Like a square again

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville
And we're makin' it like young
Love soft as April snow
Love warm as candle glow
Love, love is easy to go

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
Without him I'm no good at all
Without him I'm less than a decimal
?

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville or Wowsville
We're makin' it, makin' it like, like, like young"
The World Keeps Turning,Lisa Ekdahl,Jazz,"The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

I want my pretty baby
He says he wants me to
We wanna be together
Hope that is something we can do

I want my pretty baby
He says he wants me so bad
He knows that I got a thing for him
Hope our thing won't turn out sad

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning, world keeps turning

Here come my baby running
Part of me is in his hand
He doesn't close hard he knows then
It slips through fingers just like sand

He does't close his hand he knows then
It slips through fingers just like sand
When to give up, when to give more is
A thing that's hard to understand

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning, world keeps turning
The world keeps turning, world keeps turning
World keeps turning, world keeps turning"
Night,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Night
Have a good night
And if there's trouble on your mind
There's always tomorrow
So for now,
Turn down the

Light
Have a good time,
Enjoy the shadows
Way too beautiful
To be left behind

Life
Have a good life,
And if the last day ever
Caught you by surprise
Just pretend
There's no end...
To your goodbye"
Jeru,Miles Davis,Jazz,Instrumental
Cold as Ice,Matt Dusk,Jazz,"You're cold as Ice, Dark as night, like a thorn left in my mind
So why should I still long for you
A mistress so impossible, so cruel yet wonderful
Wise men have lost their wits over you

You make me believe you're back for good each time
Then you go and when you leave
You take my pride but I need you still
A man can need love but love never will
You're cold as Ice, cold as ice

And even when you're close to me, you're still a whisper of a dream
What am I to hold on to.
No loyalty in your design, so many lovers left behind
But even though I see right through you

You make me believe you're back for good each time
Then you go and when you leave
You take my pride but I need you still
A man can need love but love never will
You're cold as Ice, cold as ice

You make me believe you're back for good each time
Then you go and when you leave
You take my pride but I need you still
A man can feel love but love never will
You're cold as Ice, but I love you
And I always will
... I guess I always
You're cold as Ice, Dark as Night, Cold as Ice"
Misty,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, whenever you're near
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you
On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love
I'M JUST too misty
And too much
In love..."
Ain't Misbehavin',Peter Cincotti,Jazz,"No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', it's you that I'm dreamin' of
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

Don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

Don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you
All my love"
Jitter Bug,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"If you'd like to be a jitter bug
First thing you must do is get a jug
Put whiskey, wine and gin within
And shake it all up and then begin
Grab a cup and start to toss
You are drinking jitter sauce
Don't you worry, you just mug
And then you'll be a jitter bug

Hear this fat boy blowing his horn
He's been a bug since the day he was born
His favorite jitter sauce is rye
I swear, he'll drink it 'til the day he die
Toot your whistle and ring your bell
Oh, butchie-wutchie, time will tell
Don't you worry, you just mug
You'll always be a jitter bug

These four boys playing saxophone
Order jitter sauce by phone
Central, give me Harlem 4-9-4
I think these bugs could drink some more
They drink sauce from morn to night
And never stop until they're tight
Don't you worry, they just mug
They're poor little jitter bugs

Now, here's old Father, a wicked old man
Drinks more sauce than the other bugs can
He drinks jitter sauce every morn
That's why jitter sauce was born
See him shake with his trombone
He just can't leave that sauce alone
Get along, Father, you just mug
You'll always be a jitter bug

There's Rip Van with his eyes a-twinkle
We named him after Rip Van Winkle
Like Rip, he'd sleep for twenty years
If he could get his fill of beer
Rip drinks his sauce, gets on the stand
Soon he forgets that he's in the band
Don't awaken him, just let him mug
He'll always be a jitter bug"
Reaching For The Moon,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"The moon and you appear to be
So near and yet so far from me
And here am I on a night in June
Reaching for the moon and you

I wonder if we'll ever meet
My song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you

I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you"
The Very Thought Of You,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing hear for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you
My love
The mere idea of you
The longing hear for you
You never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you
My love"
This Guy's In Love With You,Steve Tyrell,Jazz,"You see this guy
This guy's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love
Who looks at you the way I do

When you smile I can tell
We know each other very well
How can I show you
I'm glad I got to know you

'Cause I've heard some talk
They say that you think I'm fine
This guy's in love
And what I'd do to make you mine

Tell me now, is it so?
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart keep breaking

'Cause, I need your love
I want your love, say you're in love
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die

Tell me now, is it so?
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart keep breaking

'Cause, I need your love
I want your love, say you're in love
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die"
Rum and Coca Cola,The Andrews Sisters,Jazz,"If you ever go down Trinidad
They make you feel so very glad
Calypso sing and make up rhyme
Guarantee you one real good fine time

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

Oh, beat it man, beat it

If the Yankee come to Trinidad
They got the young girls all goin' mad
Young girls say they treat 'em nice
Make Trinidad like paradise

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

Oh, you vex me, you vex me

Chicachicaree to Mona's Isle
Native girls all dance and smile
Help soldier celebrate his leave
Makes everyday like New Year's Eve

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

It's a fact, man, it's a fact

In old Trinidad, I also fear
The situation is mighty queer
Like the Yankee girls, the native swoon
When she hear der Bingo croon

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

Out on Manzanella Beach
G.I. romance with native peach
All night long, make tropic love
The next day, sit in hot sun and cool off

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

It's a fact, man, it's a fact

Rum and Coca-Cola
Rum and Coca-Cola
Workin' for the Yankee dollar"
Until you sleep,Anna Maria Jopek,Jazz,"Now goodnight and sleep tight, it's time
Soon a new morning will dance in your eyes
Just let the candle and moonlight all wish you a good night
With a kiss, sleep

Hush, hush, hush

My shadows are dancing for you
All your dark creatures are gathering too
And as you call them around you, they won't make a sound
Till you sleep, sleep

Hush, hush, hush

Everytime that half of the world fall asleep
Some are left counting, some slaying their sheep
And that's how it must go, but I know this hole will be safe
While you sleep, sleep

Hush, hush, hush

Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush"
Your home,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Fearless smile,
Hands of wind on golden strings
You melody,
My homeless king of joy
And sorrow,
Listen,
You,
Moon-lash smile,
My silent warrior of love,
Not too far
Between nowhere and goodbye
There's a heart
You can find,
That, can be your home now

Let me be your home now

Swinging On A Star,Bing Crosby,Jazz,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Everyday you'll meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star"
Heebie Jeebies,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Say, I've got the Heebies
I mean the Jeebies
Talking about
The dance, the Heebie Jeebies
Do, because they're boys
Because it pleases me to be joy

Say, don't you know it?
You don't know how; don't be blue
Someone will teach you
Come on and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Yes, ma'am
Papa's got the Heebie Jeebies dance

Say, come on now and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Sweet mama
Papa's got to do the Heebie Jeebies dance

Woo, got the Heebie Jeebies
Whatcha doin' with the Heebies?
I just have to have the Heebies"
Miss Otis Regrets,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She's sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in lovers lane she strayed
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

When She woke up and found that her dream of love was gone
Madam, She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her lover down
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch to day

When the Mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail
Madam, they strung her apon the willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today"
Baby I'm A Fool,Melody Gardot,Jazz,"How was I to know that this was always
Only just a little game to you
All the time I thought you gave your heart
I thought that I would do the same for you

Tell the truth
I think I should have seen it coming from a mile away
When the words you say are
Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

If I gave a thought to fascination
I would know it wasn't right to care
Logic doesn't seem to mind
That I am fascinated by a love affair

Still my heart would benefit
From a little tenderness from time to time
But never mind
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

Maybe I should hold on just a moment
And be sure it's not for vanity
Look me in the eye and tell me
Love is never based upon insanity

Hear the way my heart is beating
Hurry up, the moment's fleeting
Kiss me now, don't ask me how
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in love"
Day In Day Out,Eliane Elias,Jazz,"Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you day in, day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle, one possibility in view
The possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt
When there it is day in, day out
Day in, day out

Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you day in, day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle, one possibility in view
The possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt
When there it is day in, day out
Day in, day out, and in, and out
Day in, day out, day in and out"
I Only Have Eyes For You (03-26-52),Billie Holiday,Jazz,"My love must be a kind of blind love,
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love,
An optical illusion, too?
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 'cause I only have eyes for you.
The moon may be high,
But I can't see a thing in the sky,
'Cause I only have eyes for you.
I don't know if we're in a garden,
Or on a crowded avenue.
You are here, so am I.
Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view,
And I only have eyes for you."
Misty,Dakota Staton,Jazz,"Look at me,
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.
Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
Too misty,
And too much
In love"
Cover Me With Snow,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"I'm gonna lay this body down
Cover me with snow
Chill my burning flesh, it's scolding
Decency and pride

Cold war is over
Opening my pores
The flame each pore is breathing in
Is coming from my core

Sweet and gentle sleepiness
Coming from the cold
Come back faithful punishment
Cover me with snow
Cover me with snow

I'm gonna lay this body down
Cover me with snow
Walk these hours barefoot
Let the snowflakes be my gown

My fingers have no colors
Crystals in my hair
I feel so beautiful
My thoughts have turned to stone

Sweet and gentle sleepiness
Coming from the cold
Come back faithful punishment
Cover me with snow
Cover me with snow

It does for me what I could not
Even when I tried
It soothes my mind and leaves behind
All the times I've lied

I'm gonna lay this body down
Cover me with snow
Fall asleep with crystals
Falling silent from above"
I Put A Spell On You,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine

I can't stand it cause you put me down
Yeah, Yeah

Because you're mine
You're mine

I love ya
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now

You hear me
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine"
You're The Top,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!"
I Won't Dance,Blossom Dearie,Jazz,"I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, miss you, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do

You know what, you're handsome
You know what, too handsome
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
'Specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos and that's why

I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, Merci beau coup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms I won't dance

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
'Specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos and that's why

Which means when I'm in your arms I won't dance"

Rock-a-bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody,Judy Garland,Jazz,"Rock a bye, your baby,
With a dixie melody.
When you croon, croon a tune,
From the heart of dixie.

Just hang my cradle, mammy mine,
Right on that masoned, dixen line.
And swing it from virginia, to tennese,
With all the love that's in ya.

Weep no more, my lady,
Sing that song again, for me.
Sing on black joe, just as though,
You have me on your knees.

A Million baby kisses, I'll deliver,
If you will only play that swanee river.
Rock a bye your rock a bye baby,
With a dixie melody.

OH!Weep no more, my lady,
Sing that song again, for me.

You have me on your knees.

A Million baby kisses, I'll deliver,
If you will only play that swanee river.
Rock a bye your rock a bye baby,
With a dixie melody!"

Someday My Prince Will Come,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling a moment it will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, ""I love you""
And steal a kiss or two
No, he's far away
I'll find my love some day
When my dreams come true, come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know him the moment that we meet
For my heart will be skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
When my dreams come true"

Falling leaves, a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

You and I and
Moonlight in Vermont"

But I must confess' I'll be lonely 
But if you ever need a friend
I'm yours 'til the end
And you can depend on me

Love Is Here To Stay,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Its very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but forever and a day
The radio and the telephone, 
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies 
And in time may go

But, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Its here to stay."

This Will Make You Laugh,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"This will make you laugh,
I staked my dreams on you.
This will make you laugh,
They never did come true.

I took a chance on the one romance,
I vowed it couldn't miss.
But I should have known to never judge,
A heart borrowed kiss.

This will make you laugh,
I once believed in you.
And for all my love,
You didn't see it through.

Of all the fools, I break the rule.
I love you still you see,
This will make you laugh,
But it's not funny to me.

Them There Eyes,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes
And you have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes

They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm fallin', no stallin'
In a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin', you've started somethin'
With them there eyes

You better look out lil brown eyes... if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
Oh baby... them there eyes

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
You have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
They make me feel so happy

Solitude,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere

I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying

Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love"
The Weight,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
I said, ""Hey mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook his hand, no was all he said

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

I picked up my bag went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the devil they was walkin' side by side
I said, ""Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown""
She said, ""I gotta go, but my friend can stick around""

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

Go down Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just old Luke, Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day
""Well, Luke my friend what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor son
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?""

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me
Put the load right on me

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said, ""I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog""
I said, ""Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful woman""
He said, ""That's okay, but won't you feed him when you can""

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

Catch a cannonball now, to take me on down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fannie, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone, yes

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on
Put the load right on me"

Well I'm goin' up on the mountain to call that baby of mine

You only shutter
'Cause your poor tongue
Just won't utter the words

You can't resist him
And all you'll say

The Art Of How To Fall,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Yesterday I fell in love
And then again today
And the day before yesterday
And all the days before
I fall in love with everyone
And every time I fall
I fall in every way there is
With every little kiss

But today I fell in love again
Like I never did before
Deeper than I ever did
Could not have fallen more
Who it was I fell for
I really can't recall
I simply want to truly know
The art of how to fall

I am falling
Again and again
I am falling

The sweetness of a Hershey kiss
Is nothing to a fall
To lose is everything there is
To have another ball
It's nothing less than heavens bliss
To know a moment's time
That all there is to know is
In the art of how to fall

I am falling again
And again I am falling"
Garden In The Rain,Diana Krall,Jazz,"Twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath stars of gray
The raindrops kissed the flower beds
The blossoms raised their leafy heads
A perfumed thank you

Surely here was charm beyond
Compare to view
Maybe it was just that
I was there with you

Twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way"
Don't Want To Be a Fool,Peter White,Jazz,"Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.
I was sure up to now that she was a friend.
I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.
I once believed that love was fair.
But I don't anymore. She said I'm a bore.
My heart hit the floor.

Don't be a fool anymore.
Each time around.
I tell myself it's the game of love.
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again.
So I'll say to the end
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.

Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.
He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same.
He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way.
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.

But he'll never change. He's never gonna change.
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before
I won't look back.
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore.
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again.
So I'll swear to the end.
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)
No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Ooh, no never)
I can't be a fool, can't be. No way. No way. No way. Ooh.
I don't want to be. I don't want to be a fool. No.
I can't love anybody (I can't love nobody)
Walking on a one way street. (Any way, any way any, way no.)
If I don't (If I don't) find somebody (somebody body)
That'll be all right with me. (know, I know it'll be all right now)
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again.
So I'll stay to the end
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool)
Said I don't want to be a fool. (Don't wanna be a fool)
Ever ever again. Don't want to be a fool Can't be a fool.
Don't want to be a fool ever again.
I don't want to be a fool (Never oh never oh never again.)
Don't want to be a fool (Can't be a fool.)"
Just In Time,Steve Tyrell,Jazz,"Let's go

Just in time, you found me just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, then losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

Now you're here now, I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

Just in time

Before you came my time was running low, oh baby
I was lost, then losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go

Now you're here now, I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I've done found my way
For love came just in time, you've found me just in time

Looking for the fountain of love
We fell into a cool paradise (He yeah hey yeah)
The rhythm of the sand and the sea
Is where we've always wanted to be

I've been looking
(Looking for the fountain of love)
Searching
(Fell into the cool paradise)
I've been in search of paradise
(The rhythm of the sand and the sea)
Sand and sea
(Where we've always wanted to be)
Wanted
Always, wanted

Always searching for a new direction
Your heart desires a better state of mind
Mother nature will provide the feeling
In the sunshine, happiness you'll find

We've been holding on
Waiting for this day to come our way
Holding on
We've been holding on
Waiting for the light to shine our way
(Holding on)
Always waiting
Sayin' (free me, free me, free me)"
When It's Sleepy Time Down South,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Pale moon shining on the fields below
Folks are crooning songs soft and low
You needn't tell me so because I know
When it's sleepy time down south

Soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees
The folks down there live a life of ease
When old mammy falls on her knees
When it's sleepy time down south

Steamboats up the river a-coming or going
Splashing the night away
You hear those banjos ringing, the people are singing
They dance till the break of day, oh

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back there where I belong
Right here in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time way down south

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back there where I belong
Right here in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time
Sleepy time down south
Yes, Lord"
Singin' In The Rain,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"I'm singin' in the rain,
Just singin' in the rain.
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again.

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above,
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love,
...For love.

Let the stormy clouds chase
Ev'ryone from the place,
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face.

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singing,
Singing in the rain,
...In the rain.

Daba do do do do do
Do da do.
Daba do do do do do
Do da do.

La la la la la la
La la la la

Singing in the rain,

Stairway to the Stars,Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,Jazz,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you"
Pennies From Heaven,Louis Prima,Jazz,"If every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Each red and yella umbrella is up up up up upside down and...

Trade them all for a pack of a gum, sunshine and ravioli (Macaroni)
If you want the thing you love, you must have a pizzioli baby
And when you hear thunder don't run under a tree
It be pennies from heaven, for you and for me

Now come over here boy, Sam

And every time it rains it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
Every time it rains, it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
You find your fortune falling
All over town, all over town, all over town
Each red and yella umbrella
Is upside down twiddily bop

Old wodilly boy oh
Ah bobba hoy boy
Oh boy a hoy boy

When the Saints Go Marchin' in,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"We are trav'ling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

O when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine

Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes

When the rich go out and work

If I Didn't Care,Ink Spots,Jazz,"If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
Darlin' if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart just stands still so much?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?"

Let's Call The Whole Thing Off,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that,

Goodness knows what the end will be
Oh I don't know where I'm at
It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done:

You say either and I say either,
You say neither and I say neither
Either, either Neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off.

You like potato and I like potahto
You like tomato and I like tomahto
Potato, potahto, Tomato, tomahto.
Let's call the whole thing off

But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my heart

So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,
I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas
For we know we need each other so we
Better call the whole thing off
Let's call the whole thing off.

You say laughter and I say larfter
You say after and I say arfter
Laughter, larfter after arfter
Let's call the whole thing off,

You like vanilla and I like vanella
You saspiralla, and I saspirella
Vanilla vanella chocolate strawberry
Let's call the whole thing off

But oh if we call the whole thing of then we must part
And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my heart

So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters
For we know we need each other so we
Better call the calling off off,
Let's call the whole thing off.

I say father, and you say pater,
I saw mother and you say mater
Pater, mater Uncle, auntie let's call the whole thing off.


I like bananas and you like banahnahs
I say Havana and I get Havahnah
Bananas, banahnahs Havana, Havahnah
Go your way, I'll go mine

So if I go for scallops and you go for lobsters,
So all right no contest we'll order lobseter
For we know we need each other so we
Better call the calling off off,
Let's call the whole thing off."
Never Let Me Go,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch
What would I be without you
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress
My world was overturned
At the very start
All my bridges burned
By my flaming heart

You'd never leave, me would?
You couldn't, hurt me?
Never let me go
Never let me go"
So What!,Ronny Jordan,Jazz,"Miles Davis walked off the stage
That's what the folks are all saying
Oh yes, he did leave the stage
After his solo was all over

Coltrane he walked off the stage
That's what the folks are all saying
Yes, they both left the stage
Clean out of sight

They felt they had to rehearse
Although we know they are masters
They get a real groovy sound
And you will have to admit it

Yes, they both left the stage
Soon as their solo's were over
And if you can't figure out
Their groove I'd like to help you
Their groove, I've helped you

So what"

No Good Man,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"No good man
Lovin' all the no good things
Never treats me as he should
That ain't no good
He's always bringing me down
He's no saint
Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly
Not on me
I'm the one who gets the run-around

I ought to hate him and yet I love him so
For I require
Love that's made of fire
And in his arms
I find
I always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began
There have been other fools like me
Born to be
In love with a no good man"
I'm Glad There Is You,Natalie Cole,Jazz,"Said I, many times, love is illusion,
A feeling result of confusion.
With knowing smile, and blazing sigh,
A cynical so-and-so was i.

I felt so sure, so positive,
So utterly, unchangingly certain.
But I never was aware of love and you,

And suddenly I realized 
There was love and you,
And I, and i.

In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you

In this world of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love, I love to live with you beside me
This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

More than ever, I'm glad there is you"
Come Rain or Come Shine,Robin McKelle,Jazz,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine

You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Sinkin' Soon,Norah Jones,Jazz,"We're an oyster cracker on the stew
And the honey in the tea
We're the sugar cubes, one lump or two
In the black coffee
The golden crust on an apple pie
That shines in the sun at noon
We're a wheel of cheese high in the sky
But we're gonna be sinkin' soon

In a boat that's built of sticks and hay
We drifted from the shore
With a captain who's too proud to say
That he dropped the oar
A tiny hole has sprung a leak
In this cheap pontoon
Now the hull has started growing weak
And we're gonna be sinkin' soon

We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
Everybody hold your breath 'cause
We're gonna be sinkin' soon

We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
Everybody hold your breath 'cause
Down and down we go...

Like the oyster cracker on the stew
The honey in the tea
The sugar cubes, one lump or two?
No thank you, none for me
We're the golden crust on the apple pie
That shines in the sun at noon
Like the wheel of cheese high in the sky
Well... we're gonna be sinkin' soon"
Mr. Wonderful,Peggy Lee,Jazz,"Why this feeling? Why this glow?
Why the thrill when you say hello?
It's a strange and tender magic you do
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

Why this trembling when you speak
Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

Oh there's much more I could say
But the words keep slipping away
And I'm left with one point of view
Mister Wonderful, that's you

One more thing, then I'm through
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful, I love you"
Afro-Blue,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Dream of a land my soul is from
I hear a hand stroke on a drum
Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers are face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away
To some secluded place
Whispering trees echo their sighs
Passionate pleas, tender replies

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers in flight
Upward they climb
Burst at the height
Slowly subside
My slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it's not a dream
The two are you and me

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue"
Blue Rose,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Blue as the crying sky
With no thorn, and no thistle
Only an open face
Staring at the waking world

Maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

Her arms stretch wide
To receive life
And her roots go deep into the black earth for strength
And she blooms

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

She blooms while the people sleep
Only the travelers see her
To those who rise with the noon day sun
She is a closed mystery

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Oh, maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine"
That Old Black Magic,Marilyn Monroe,Jazz,"That old black magic has me in its spell,
That old black magic that you weave so well.
Those icy fingers up and down my spine,
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine,
The same old tingle that I feel inside,
And then that elevator starts its ride,
And, baby, down and down I go,
Round and round I go,
Like a leaf that's caught in a tide.
I shoud stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm a flame,
A flame with such a burning desire,
That only your kiss can put out the fire,
For you're the lover that I have waited for,
The mate that Fate had me created for.
And every time your lips meet mine, darling,
Down and down I go,
Round and round I go,
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in,
Under that old black magic called love!"
Out Of This World,June Christy,Jazz,"You're clear out of this world
When I am looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was so high
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a laurel life

And I after waiting so long for the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from the long and lonely nighttime
And despite time, here you are

I'd cry out of this world
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you

After waiting so long for the right time
After reaching so long for a star
And at once from the long and lonely nighttime
And despite time, here you are

I'd cry out of this world
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you

You're clear, out of this world
Out of this world, out of this world"
Nosey Joe,The Brian Setzer Orchestra,Jazz,"Written by J. Lieber and M. Stoller

There's a man in town all the women know
He goes by the name of Nosey Joe
He don't care if they're married
He takes his pick
Long as they're women, he's ready to stick

His big nose in their business
His big nose in their business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

He ain't good lookin' and he ain't big and strong
The guy's got a nose that's four foot long
I'm tellin' you women, this ain't no jive
If you get too close this man will drive

His big nose in your business
His big nose in your business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

I saw him just the other day
Tried to steal my gal away
He offered her money
He offered her love
She said thank you sir, but please don't shove

Your big nose in my business
Your big nose in my business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

Old Nosey finally lost his life
Messin' with my buddy's wife
My buddy caught him with his chick
Chopped off his nose, now he can't stick

His big nose in my business
His big nose in my business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know"
Georgia On My Mind,Mildred Bailey,Jazz,"Melodies bring memories
That linger in my heart
Make me think of Georgia
Why did we ever part?

Some sweet day when blossoms fall
And all the world's a song
I'll go back to Georgia '
'Cause that's where I belong

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind, Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pine

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind

Always on my mind though
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly but
Still in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
(Georgia, Georgia)
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind
(Can't forget you, it's true)
Keeps Georgia on my mind"
How are you gonna deal with it,Silje Nergaard,Jazz,"The storm that is underway is gonna rock that house of yours
Leaving you no place to hide
How are you gonna manage from then on
The wind that is but a moan will soon be howling at your door
You're tucked up safe inside
But are you gonna stay in till it's gone

You check locks and latches
And batten down hatches
But the gale will send flying all that it catches

How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything you had got planned
Seems to come crashing down... there... before your eyes
How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything gets out of hand... and all that once mattered
Is picked up and scattered
You're out in the cold
But you hold on and hope to survive

When the dust has all settled you'll find a way to survive
Still closed up or open wide
How are you gonna play it from now on
The storm has passed and you're relieved
Love's still alive
It could have curled up and died
There is no way to play it when it's gone

You check locks and latches
And batten down hatches
But the gale will send flying all that it catches

How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything you had got planned
Seems to come crashing down... there... before your eyes
How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything gets out of hand... and all that once mattered
Is picked up and scattered
You're out in the cold
But you hold on and hope to survive"
If My Heart Could Only Talk,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"If my heart could only talk
Heaven would be mine
If my heart could only talk

It would thrill you until you willingly surrender

If my heart could only talk
Dreams would all come true
'Neath the starlight I would walk
Hand in hand with you
I would have to seek your lips
Thrill you to your fingertips
If my heart could onlitalk

Hand in hand with you
I would have to seek your lips
Thrill you to your fingertips
If my heart could only talk"
Wish I Could (Live),Norah Jones,Jazz,"We met in a place I used to go
Now I just walk by it for show
Can't bear to go in without you, you know
Wish I could
Wish I could

But Annie is standing in the door
With a look on her face I can't just ignore
She tells me that her heart is sore
And pulls me in
She pulls me in

She says ""love in the time of war is not fair""
""He was my man but they didn't care""
""Sent him far away from here""
""No goodbye""
""No goodbye""

I don't tell her that I once loved you too
Or about all the things we used to do
I kiss her hair and think of you
Walking down
The road you found

We met in a place I used to go
Now I only walk by it slow
Can't bear to go in without you, you know
Wish I could
Wish I could
Wish I could
Wish I could"
Georgia On My Mind,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Georgia
Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia
Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you
Georgia
Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind"
Basin Street Blues,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Won't you come and go with me
Down that Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Come along with me on, down to new orleans

Now the band's there to greet us
Old friends will meet us
Where all them folks goin' to the St. Louis cemetery meet
Heaven on earth, they call it basin street

I'm tellin' ya, basin street is the street
Where all them characters from the first street they meet
New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never miss them rice and beans
Way down south in New Orleans

They'll be huggin' and a kissin'
That's what I been missin'
And all that music lord, if you just listen
New orleans, I got them basin street blues

Now ain't you glad you went with me
On down that Mississippi
We took a boat to the land of dreams
Heaven on earth they call it basin street"
Chattanooga Choo Choo,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"(Hi there Tex, what you say)
Step aside partner, it's my day
Bend an ear and listen to my version
(Of a really solid Tennesse excursion)

Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
(Yes yes track twenty-nine)
Boy, you can gimme a shine

(Can you afford
To board the Chattanooga choo choo?)
I've got my fare
(And just a trifle to spare)

You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
(Then to have your ham an' eggs in Carolina)

When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
(Woo, woo, Chattanooga there you are)

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace (doo doo)
I used to call ""Funny Face""

She's gonna cry
Until I tell her that I'll never roam
(So Chattanooga choo choo)
Won't you choo-choo me home?

(Chattanooga Chattanooga)
Get aboard
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)
All aboard
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)

(Chattanooga choo choo)
Won't you choo-choo me home?

Little Farley,Harry Connick_ Jr.,Jazz,"Little Farley
Why you hangin' out so long
I can tell by the people
You're runnin' with
That you're singin' a different song
Little Farley
What you hidin in your drawer
Don't you know that I know what you're doin'
And it ain't worth dyin' for
Little Farley
Why you takin' that to school
Livin' out your life in Angola
Really don't sound too cool
Little Farley
Why you wanna take a life
That little girl they laid to rest today
She coulda been your wife
Little Farley
You know that don't belong to you
What you took in less than a minute
Mighta took him a month or two
Little Farley
A boy don't have to be a man
If you can't decide what you wanna be
Then I'm tellin' you no one can

Think about it..."
I Get Along Without You Very Well,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I get along without you very well,
Of course I do,
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms.
Of course, I do,
But I get along without you very well.

I've forgotten you just like I should,
Of course I have,
Except to hear your name,
Or someone's laugh that is the same,
But I've forgotten you just like I should.

What a guy, what a fool am I,
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon.
What's in store? Should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune.

I get along without you very well,
Of course I do,
Except perhaps in Spring,
But I should never think of Spring,
For that would surely break my heart in two."
My Funny Valentine,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend,
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere,
And slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day"
If I Should Lose You,Nina Simone,Jazz,"If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in maytime 
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around 
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain 
If I lost you"
When You Wish Upon a Star,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true"
The Ice Hotel,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
The Caribbean's all booked out
And that's just as well
Once I'd have been much keener
On Barbados and Antigua
But just now I think the Arctic will suit us well
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

They've built it all with ice, that's pure and clear
The sofas, the lobby
Even the chandelier
A thermostat guarantees
A steady minus five degrees
What other place could serve our needs so well?
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Romantic places
Like Verona or Paris
They'll always lead you astray
You'd have to be a novice
To ever trust Venice
And those dreamy waterways
And what the tropics can do
I know only too well
So, let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Heavy clothing at all times
Is the expected norm
Even candlelight at dinner
Is considered too dangerously warm
And when the time comes for us to sleep
We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
And curl up together
On an ice block carved for two
But then in the morning
Provided we've made it through...

We'll step out together
To watch the sun rise over
That vast expanse of cold
And who knows if we're lucky
We may find ourselves talking
Of what the future may hold
This is no whim of the moment
I want you to realize
Let's go away
To that palace made of ice

Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
The Bahamas are all booked out
And that's just as well
I don't think we're quite ready
For Hawaii or Tahiti
And when we will be
Only time will tell
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel"
One Of These Days,Room Eleven,Jazz,"Traffic lights and a lot of different voices
A breeze in the trees
Evening sun... oh yeah it's Saturday
Sweet summer music very fine
Too many shiny lips
Drinking too much wine
Flying dresses red and blue
Seem to walk in circles
Like tigers in high heeled shoes

It's too damn hot
I wish I'd fit my shoes
My hands are sweaty
And my belt is too tight
Ooh!
Reminds me of a chocolate I ate last night
It was hard to fight
Packed train bad news surrounds me
Testing my nerves

It's one of these days
Thunder is coming
Rain will soon start to fall
It's one of these days
Light-years of waiting
It seems like forever before you call

Steamy chat
Six White Russians
And a Pink Pussycat
Stumbling on the dance floor
Tripping on my tongue
Asking for more
Staring in another pair of eyes
And another Brazilian Sunrise
And another one
Oops, I spilt some on my T-shirt
Do I look desperate?

It's one of these days
The birds in the trees seem to sing more
And everything around me seems to shine
Oh, it's one of these days
Bright days are coming
And all the good looking men are mine

It's one of these days
Love seems to try me
Finding myself laughing to loud
It's one of these days
The birds in the trees seem to sing more
And everything around me seems to shine
It's one of these days
Wow, and all the good looking men are mine
Oh, it's one of these days
Love seems to try me
And everything around me seems to shine!"
A Fine Romance,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"A fine romance with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge with my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take Jell-o
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins to express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance"
Let Yourself Go,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So:

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""No, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go"
Nature Song,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"When the leaves began to fall
I heard
Nature's lonesome cry of wisdom

All the birds had flown away
While I stayed
And watched alone the sky turn gray

But then winter came on a cloudy night
With the saddest smile in a bag of ice
Told me don't be afraid of the lonely times

Then winter came on a cloudy night
In a moonlight dance with a starless sky
Told me come dance with me
You'll keep warm and wise

And then, on a sunny April day
Spring came by
With sparkling trees and green leaves
And all the birds came back to sing
The sweetest melodies, delivered by the breeze
. To my ears"
Just A Little Moon,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Just a little moon
Shining on my love tonight
The night is open wide
And I lay by his side

All the guests went home
We closed the door to what is gone
And now this little moon is peeking through our rooms

And all else shall be
Quiet, nothing shall disturb
The given bliss, the grace
The new that's in his face
Reflecting that one of my own
Finally we are alone
Here we lay in moonlight arms
A kiss can't do us any harm

Just a little moon
Young and true an just for us
We cannot change the stars
But we can see the moon at last

And all else shall be
Quiet, nothing shall disturb
The given bliss, the grace
The new that's in his fac
Reflecting that one of my own
Finally we are alone
Here we lay in moonlight arms
The day can't do us any harm,

Here we lay in moonlight arms
Not a thing can do us harm
Here we lay in moonlight arms
The day can't do us any harm"
Five O'Clock Whistle,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"The five o'clock whistle's on the blink
The whistle won't blow and whadd'ya think?
My pop is still in the factory 'cause he don't know
What time it happens to be

The five o'clock whistle didn't blow
The whistle is broke and whadda'ya know?
If somebody don't find out what's wrong
Oh, my pop'll be workin' all night long

Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
Won't somebody fix the whistle?
Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
So my poor old pop will know it's time for him to stop

Ya ought to hear what my mommy said
When papa came home and sneaked into bed
And told her he worked till half past two
'Cause the five o'clock whistle never blew"
A Time For Love,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love"
Lazy River,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Up a lazy river by the old mill stream
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along
Blue skies up above everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along
There are blue skies up above and as long as we're in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be
If you go up a lazy river with me
Ah said with me now goin' up that lazy river with me"
He Needs Me,Nina Simone,Jazz,"He needs me
He doesn't know it,
But he needs me
And so no matter where he goes,
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm there

He needs me
I oughta leave him,
But he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his... And I'm here

And I'm gonna be his friend,
Or his lover
Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover that 
He needs me
I've got to follow where he leads me
Or else he'll never know 
That I need him
Just as he needs me"
Everything Happens for the Best,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Always blue all in a mist
It's plain as can be
You're so mean to me
But everything happens for the best
You always play around
You're running my heart so deep in the ground
That O.K. everything happens for the best
I loved you so madly
Knew you would be true
Now this thing has happened dear
It's over all over because we're through
So sorry dear it end this way
Since the world begin
The old folks say
Everything happens for the best

I loved you so madly
Knew you would be true
Now this thing has happened dear
It's over all over because we're through
So sorry dear it end this way
Since the world begin
The old folks say
Everything happens for the best"
New Orleans,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"If you've never seen a quaint old Southern city
Just think of New, think of New Orleans

If you've never seen that town, boy, it's a pity
There's nothing like, nothing like New Orleans

It will remind you old fashioned lace
A glass of wine will greet your smiling face

And if you ever see a black-eyed gal like mine, boy
Oh, then you're right in it, right in New Orleans"
Makin' Whoopee,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks
That's what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year, maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

Yeah, she sits alone
Most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he's busy
But she says, ""is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

Now he doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per

Than makin' whoopee.""

How Sweet It Is To Be In Love,Johnny Hartman,Jazz,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you"
Keeper Of The Flame,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I'm the keeper of the flame
My torch of love lights his name
Ask no pity, beg my shame
I'm the keeper of the flame

Played with fire and I was burn
Gave a heart but I was spurn
All these time I have yearned
Just to have my love return

Years have passed by
The spark still remains
True love can't die
It smoulders in flame
When the fire is burning off
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
I'm the keeper of the flame

Years have passed by

And the angels call my love
Dying love will leave no doubt

You're My Thrill,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

Hmmm-nothing seems to matter
Hmmm-here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps morning higher
When I look at you
I cann't keep still
You're my thrill"

Strange Fruit,Nina Simone,Jazz,"Lewis Allen, Sonny White 

Southern trees
Bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop

As sung by Billie Holiday

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter cry."

She Wears Black,Incognito,Jazz,"(G. Harvey, R. Hope-Taylor, J.P. Maunick) 

 Instrumental"
The Copenhagen Cavern,Kari Bremnes,Jazz,"We'd been walking so far,
Where the houses lean together,
On cobblestones not made for my high heels.
As we drifted along,
Slowed down by the weather,
No need to talk
About the way that summer feels.

We went into a doorway
To a run-down bar beneath the ground,
To a place that the sun has never been.

Coming in from the day
To the darkness and the shadows,
The feeble lights could not dispel the gloom.
Slowly making our way,
We found an empty table.
The winter seemed to live inside this room.

This Copenhagen cavern:
A run-down bar beneath the ground,
A place that the sun has never seen.

Like a frail figurine,
She walked between the tables
With a vacant look and thinly braided hair.
She was all of sixteen,
Straight from a Dickens fable,
She was pleading for some money
For her fare.

The Copenhagen waiter
Wanted her back on the street,
But some impulse
Made us offer her a chair.

As I started to speak
I sensed a strong emotion.
She said I am from northern Norway, too,
She had come for a week,
A journey with her school friends
But a year had passed her by
Before she knew.

She said: I come from Senja,
A village on the outer coast,
But the climate here
Affected me much more.

Walking into the lane,
Looking back in through the window,
The light of day now seemed a little strange.
Would she leave for the train,
Would she stay another winter?
She moved betweeen the tables
Begging chance.

We'd been walking so far
Through cobblestone back alleys
No need to talk about
The way that summer feels."
Baby Don't You Quit Now,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"What you do to me
You get through to me
With a beautiful vibration
That is new to me
And instead of no
What comes out is, Oh
Baby, baby, don't you quit now

When tomorrow lips
Meet two coral lips
Then they kiss me, now and later
We can quarrel lips

I should turn you off
But you turn me on
So baby, baby don't you quit now

Every kiss I take
Is a piece of cake
And to give me a sample
Was your first mistake
'Cause I know when a little tastes like more
And now I want the whole darn
Bakery store

Take my pay from me
Christmas day from
Go anywhere you want
Except away from me
Quit tomorrow noon
Or nine o'clock
The fifth of June
But baby, don't you quit now

I should turn you off
But you turn me on
Baby, baby don't you quit now

Aha ha ha ha ha
La dee da da da dee da da

Quit tomorrow noon
Or at nine o'clock
The fifth of June
But baby, don't quit now"
Summer Breeze,Wayman Tisdale,Jazz,"You've been like a summer breeze
There's nothin' like a summer breeze

So fine

Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine"
Leaving Again/In The Wee Small Hours,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"Sleeping, waking, crying, leaving again
It's morning I have to go
Though every night pretends
Begins in quiet hoping that it never ends

They're always ending again
Breaking another dream
A dream where we could breathe
In the heavy curtained Prairie air of summer night

Watching lightning over wheat fields
Through a bedroom window
And the prairie gently rose up
With a feeling and embraced us

And when morning found us
I pulled you to me and promised to stay
But that was the night and now day

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never ever think of counting sheep

And when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
For in the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all"
Stormy Weather,Ethel Waters,Jazz,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

I walk around
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time"
Remember,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
But soon the May-time turned to December
You had forgotten; do you remember?"
Grandma's Hands,Al Jarreau,Jazz,"Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say: Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her
Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say"" Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn' drop no apple core
But I don't have Grandma anymore

If I get to Heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands"
This Is Always,Roberta Gambarini,Jazz,"Our love will live
Our love will last
This is not a dream
That ended with the dawn
It's one that fate intended
To go on and on

This isn't sometimes
This is always
This isn't maybe
This is always
This is love
The real beginning of forever

This isn't just
Midsummer madness
A passing glow
A moment's gladness
Yes, this is love
I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string
Around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that
This is always

This is always
This is always

This is always
This is always

You tied a string
Around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know
That this is always"
You Bring New Stars,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Dear Angels We have not spoken for a while
I don't know if I do this right
God knows I have forgotten what I knew
I don't know any longer what is true

So I ask and stay still

Bring me new stars in my heaven
Show me where the sun's at night

Dear Angels as I lay still I find you here
You speak so softly but not to my ears
Dear Angels is it me who called you first
Or is my calling, the answer to your care

I know as I'm still

You bring new stars
To my heaven
You show me where the sun's at night

You place new stars in my heaven
You show me where the sun's at night

You are here to see me through to you
You place new stars in my heaven
You take me to the sun at night

You place new stars in my heaven
You take me to the sun at night"
Lonely House (Stereo),June Christy,Jazz,"At night when everything is quiet
This old house seems to breathe a sigh
Sometimes I hear a neighbor snoring
Sometimes I can hear a baby cry

Sometimes I can hear a staircase creaking
Sometimes a distant telephone
Oh, and when the night settles down again
This old house and I are all alone

Lonely house, lonely me
Funny with so many neighbors
How lonesome you can be

Lonely town, lonely street
Funny, you can be so lonely
With all these folks around

I guess there must be something
I don't comprehend
Sparrows have companions
Even stray dogs have a friend

The night for me is not romantic
Unhook the stars and take them down
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house

The night, the night for me is not romantic
Unhook the stars and take them down
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house
At night when everything is quiet"
Because Of You,Sammy Davis Jr,Jazz,"Because of you there's a song in my heart
Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever and never to part

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile
Because of you

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile
Because of you"
Stardust,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that were apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust
Of yesterday
The music
Of the years
Gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you.
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
But that was long ago, and now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew.
Though I dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain."
Mr Sandman,The Puppini Sisters,Jazz,"Mr. Sandman

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream (bung, bung, bung, bung)
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen (bung, bung, bung, bung)

When I Get Over You,Randy Crawford,Jazz,"Everybody sees some changes
Everybody sheds a skin or two
You won't recognize me
When I get over you

Unattended dreams will breathe life
All my wishes will come true
And there'll be time for everything
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

I'm setting free the monkey
I'm setting free the lions too
Yesterday's child will grow up wild
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

I'll be wearing a fairy-tale
I'll walk in glass high-heeled shoes
And there'll be a moral to the story
When I get over you

I'll be the life of the party
I'll misbehave and act the fool
I won't care who knows me
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

When I get over you
Yeah
The skies will still be blue
I said I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you..."
Deep Waters,Incognito,Jazz,"Deep Waters

It is a crime for me to be feeling this way
I'm going out of my mind and there's chang from a runaway love

Is it a dream (is it a dream)
That I'm throwing in the wishing well.
I'm losing control body and soul
Standing here waiting for a train that may never come

I saw the signs I read the book I should of had a second look
But boy you caught me dreaming
And there were times you'd come around and we agreed to just be friends
Tell me who was foolin who.

Deep waters I'm drowning deep waters slowly drowning deeper (repeat once)

What do I say (what can I say)
When words have failed me before
What do I do when I'm feeling so blue
And there's no place for me to run and hide.

I saw the sun inside your smile and wished for more than just a while
'Cause boy you caught me dreaming
A giant step into the dark we threw caution to the wind
Tell me who was fooling who.

MMMM I'm drownin

Deeper deeper deeper I'm drowning deeper

Oh I saw the signs I read the book I should have had a second look
'Cause boy you caught me dreamin'
And there are times you come around and we'd agreed to just be friends
Tell me who was really foolin who"

I'm through with bymays his way is may way forever more
Lord when I feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
So I'm changing my style my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man got my Porgy now

Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah

Now how could you ask for more?

So come what may, I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years, day by day"

And though I close my eyes I see la vie en rose

And when you speak angels sing from above
Everyday words seems, to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be la vie en rose"

We've come this far by grace
And when you pray to find your place
Love will lead the way

In the shadows of the valley
Tears mingle with rain
A shining light will break my darkness
And mercy will remain

Bless the seven souls who raised me
Back in Georgia state
And tell my loved ones not to worry
My love will conquer hate

Love will lead the way"

Sweet Nothing,Working Week,Jazz,"There ain't no such thing
As a free lunch my friend,
You've always got to pay,
When they stand there
In your way.
And there ain't no such thing
As a rich man's charity,
You've got to understand,
When he gives
That helping hand,
That there ain't no such thing
As a cut price ambition.
It's sweet nothing,
You're left with
Nothing at all.

There's no easy road
To a new life my friend,
Sometimes you face the pain,
Pick yourself up, start again.
But the love that you find
In the darkness of the night,
You can take it in your arms,
Feel it in your heart.
If you hold it and trust it,
It'll cost you the price of
Sweet nothing.
Sweet nothing.
You're left with nothing
Gotta find a friend,
With you to the end,
More than just a trend,
That won't leave you
On the shelf.
Gotta realise,
What you've got inside,
Better than a lie,
Help you have faith
In yourself.
Living on the line,
Gotta grab the time,
Now that you will find,
It's more than
Fame and wealth.
And hoping and loving
Can cost you the price of
Sweet nothing.
Boy, have faith in yourself,
Boy, believe in yourself,
Don't let them take
Your freedom,
It's with you till the end.
Believe in yourself."

Till I make you happy, too"

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

In Love In Vain,Nina Simone,Jazz,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain

And cry your eyes out and rack your brain

Could 'cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven, but I'm only up a tree
'Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain"
Isn't This a Lovely Day?,Fred Astaire,Jazz,"The weather is frightening, the thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day

The turn in the weather will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day
And everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke, and oh, what a break for me

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter-patter but it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day"
You and I,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"Poet and musician sing the same old tune

And we know why birds in the trees sing melodies too
And why love will grow from the first ""hello"" until the last ""goodbye""
So to sweet romance, there is just one answer, you and I

It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),Duke Ellington & His Orchestra,Jazz,"What good is melody?
What good is music?
If it ain't possessing something sweet

It ain't the melody
It ain't the music
There's something else that makes this song complete

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Well it don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev-ry-thing you got YES

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing

It don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing boy

I said it don't mean a thing and all you got to do is sing

Now it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev-ry-thing you got Oh
It don't mean a thing boy, if it ain't got-a-that-a-swinga

Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe,Abbey Lincoln,Jazz,"It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He got a smile that make the lilac wanna grow
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
Soon he kiss me and its Christmas everywhere
Trouble fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? that's all I has to know
Seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe

It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He got a smile that make the lilac wanna grow
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
Soon he kiss me and its Christmas everywhere
Trouble fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? that's all I has to know
Seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe

Some Kind Of Wonderful,Peter Cincotti,Jazz,"(Music & Lyrics by Gerald Goffin & Carole King)

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me that you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Anytime my little world turns blue
I just have to look at you
Everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Oh wonderful, some kind of wonderful"
If I Were A Bell,Blossom Dearie,Jazz,"Ask me how do I feel now that we're cozy and clinging
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light or if I were a banner I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a gate I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs
Well and if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong, ding

Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson I'm leaning
Well sir, all I can say if I were a bridge I'd be burning
Yes, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack or if I were a goose I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel, now that we're finally caressing
Pal, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Yes or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong, ding

Ask me how do I feel, now that we're cozy and clinging
Well, sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight"
Jersey Girl,Holly Cole,Jazz,"Got no time for the corner boys

Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival

Darn That Dream,Miles Davis,Jazz,"Darn that dream

I'm Puttin' All My Eggs In One Basket,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"I've been a roaming Romeo
My Juliets have been many
But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on:

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

Saved up in my love account

Love divided
In two
Won't do

When I try to
Be true
To two

Stronger,Room Eleven,Jazz,"Black days
The shower is still at the height you left it
I haven't moved
And the room is only getting bigger
Time chews on my bones
Got to get out of here
I'm meant for more important things

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day

I brush the words off my tongue
But the stories still remain
They keep reminding me
Show the road behind me
And cut the map of my dreams into pieces
Can't find the crossroad where it all went wrong
Where it all went wrong

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day

I've got memories
They are a remedy
And a few evil thoughts
I still got your key
I save my energy
I'll be stronger than be before
I'll get up and open some new doors

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day"
Precious Years,Matt Dusk,Jazz,"(Robin Smith / Mark Niedzwiedz)

When love is young
The tallest tree
Is there to climb
Is evergreen
In summer fields we dream our dreams
When love is young

When love is young
The air is sweet
Forbidden fruit is all we eat
An august moon is your conceit
When love is young

These are precious years
Such intoxicating years
When our innocence slowly comes undone
Hearts are spilt on purest silk
When love is young

instrumental

These are precious years
Such intoxicating years
When our innocence slowly comes undone
Hearts are spilt on purest silk
When love is young

When love is young
The glass is full
No empty chairs, no silent walls
Like warriors, we conquer all
When love is young

These are precious years
Such intoxicating years
When our innocence slowly comes undone
Hearts are spilt on purest silk
These precious years
These precious years
Never will grow old
They are forever gold"
What Are You Doing The  Rest Of Your Life?,Maysa,Jazz,"What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and south and east and west of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of gold and forest overnight
And when you stand before the candles on the cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love you keep in your eyes
I'll awake and rest asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two 

And you are my life
Summer, winter, spring, and fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you

All I ask with you
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you

All I ask with you
With you"
Mr. Tru Love,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Mr. Tru Love,
Dancin' and beaming on my blurry sky.
You're like moonglow
And right by my window you came to hide.

Mr Tru Love,
Trading my teardrops for a smile.
Can I let you go,
And get back to loneliness for a little while?

'Cause I've been waiting so long for someone like you,
And now that you're here I'm so helpless and hazy with you.

Oh, Mr Tru Love,
Always enchanting my weary eye.
Don'tell me even if you know: when you strike like thunder, do you always have to die?

'Cause I've been waiting so long for someone like you,
And now that you're here I'm so helpless and hazy with you.

'Cause I've been waiting so long for someone like you,
And now that you're here I'm so helpless and hazy with you."

Some Lessons,Melody Gardot,Jazz,"Well I'm buckled up inside
It's a miracle that I'm alive
I do not think I can survive
On bread and wine alone
To think that I could have fallen
A centimeter to the left
Would not be here to see the sunset
Or have myself a time
Well why do the hands of time
So easily unwind
Some lessons we learn the hard way
Some lessons don't come easy
That's the price we have to pay
Some lessons we learn the hard way
They don't come right off and right easy
That's why they say some lessons learned we learn the hard way

Remember the sound of the pavement
World turned upside down
City streets unlined and empty
Not a soul around
Life goes away in a flash
Right before your eyes
If I think real hard well I reckon
I've had some real good times
Well why do the hands of time
So easily unwind
Some lessons we learn the hard way
Some lessons don't come easy
That's the price we have to pay
Some lessons we learn the hard way
They don't come right off and right easy
That's why they say some lessons learned we learn the hard way"
Born to Sail Away,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Only child of moon and sun
She learned to love the space between each one.
Lots of freedom, lots of room so she could bloom.

The braces taught her how to smile
She wasn't shy but laughing took a while.
All her teachers were surprised
She wanted first to fall and then to rise.

She was born to sail away...
She was born to sail away...

On a shore of crooked stripes
She wondered where all the stars had gone to
Till she found them in his eyes, the perfect love she could grow in... in two.

But she was born to sail away...
She was born to sail away.

Wind blows and time flies by her
She knows she's goin' somewhere
Wind blows and time flies by her
She knows she's goin' somewhere...

But she was born to sail away...
She was born to sail away...
Born to sail away
She was born to sail away."
Sweet Lorraine,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"I've just found joy
I'm as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When I'm with my sweet Lorraine

A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer skies
When you see her you will realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

Now when it's raining I don't miss the sun
'Cause its in my baby's smile
And to think that I'm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
I can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine"
Return To Paradise,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"Come my love with me

Come with me and find
Your peace of mind,
Return to paradise!

Velvet moon above,
Evil turns to love,
Love evermore!

Your peace of mind,

Lullaby Of Birdland,Sarah Vaughan,Jazz,"Lullaby of birdland
That's what I
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase, how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtledoves
Bill and coo
When they love
That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weapy 'ol willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry on my pillow
If you should tell me
Farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland
Whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland,
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love"

Phrase you thought never would phase you
Well baby, you better hold on tight

Kneel down and propose, well all right

Always be caught up in love with me

Have the answer of whether we'll be
Or whether we won't be
In love...

Streets Of Philadelphia,Molly Johnson,Jazz,"I was bruised and battered
And I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window 
I didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me
Wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue 
Till my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends 
Vanished and gone
At night I could hear the
Blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia"

It has turned off and gone"
way back,Jazzamor,Jazz,"1
No looking back
Face the facts you said
Fait accompli (it's over)
Get out of my face
I prayed

Remembering the old schoolyard
Cheek to cheek and heart to heart
You and me so crazy
Really thrilled to bits

We've been young and we've been free
Been having confidence in love and honesty

Hey babe
The simple things and time were on our side
Way back when love was on your mind
Was on your mind

2
Friday night we made grade
Dressed to kill couldn't hardly wait
In the early morning rain
We've been searching for a place to stay
The old oak gave us shelter then you took my breath away

We've been young and we've been free
Been having confidence in love and honesty

Hey babe
The simple things and time were on our side
Way back when love was on your mind
Was on your mind"
In The Still Of The Night,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window 
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
The times without number
Darling that I say to you

Do you love me 
As I love you
Are you my life to be
My dream come true
Or will that dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night"
Rockin' Chair,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies round this rockin' chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rockin' chair gets it, Judgement Day is here
Chained to my rockin' chair

Old rockin' chair's got me, son, (Rocking chair got you, father)
My cane by my side, (Yes, your cane by your side)
Now fetch me a little gin, son (Ain't got no gin, father)

Just sittin' me here grabbin' (Grabbin')
At the flies round this old rockin' chair (Rockin' chair)

Chained to my rockin', old rockin' chair"
I Cried For You,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I've found two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
I've found a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me"
The Waking,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.
I learn by going where I have to go.

We think by feeling. What is there to know?
I hear my being dance from ear to ear.
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.

Of those so close beside me, which are you?
God bless the Ground! I shall walk softly there,
And learn by going where I have to go.

Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?

The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.

Great Nature has another thing to do
To you and me, so take the lively air,
And, lovely, learn by going where to go.

This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.
What falls away is always. And is near.
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I learn by going where I have to go."
It's Not Unusual,Willie Bobo,Jazz,"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
Oh I wanna' die
It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day no matter what you say
You find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find out that I'm in love with you
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh"
I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,Steve Tyrell,Jazz,"I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad when I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose needs the sun and the rain
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
Baby if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back I will be around, just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do
I don't know what else to do"
Walk Like An Egyptian,The Puppini Sisters,Jazz,"All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick, oh, whey, oh
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles, oh, whey, oh
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Walk like an Egyptian

The blond waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves, oh, whey, oh
You drop your drink then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings, oh, whey, oh
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm then you pull it back
Life is hard you know, oh, whey, oh
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance, oh, whey, oh
They spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the cops in the donut shop say
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian"
Forty-Second Street,The Boswell Sisters,Jazz,"Come and meet
Those dancing feet
On the avenue I'm taking you to
Forty-Second Street

Hear the beat
Of dancing feet
It's the song I love the melody of
Forty-Second Street

Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet

Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite

Strange Fruit,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant South
The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop"
Sukiyaki,Tuck & Patti,Jazz,"It's all because of you
I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away
Now my life is just a rainy day and I love you so
How much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely.

Untouchable memories
Keep on haunting me
Another love so true
That once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Oh I can't stop this love that I have for you
Now that you are gone I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine
Once again you'll be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
You took your love away from me.

Oh I can't stop this love that I have for you
Now that you are gone I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine
Once again you'll be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
You took your love away from me.

Oh, you took your love
You took it away from me.
Oh, I know in reality, you and I will never be
You took your love away from me.

Me, I wish the sun would shine
And once again you'll be mine all mine
Oh, but in reality, you and I will never be
Oh, you and I will never be

I look up where I go
So the tears won't fall
I look up where I go
So the tears won't fall

Up On The Roof,Peter Cincotti,Jazz,"(Music & Lyrics by Gerald Goffin & Carole King)

When this old world starts a getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get away from the hustling crowd
And all the rat-race noise down in the street

On the roof, the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so

At night the stars put on a show for free
Darling, you can share it all with me

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's troubleproof
If this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof
Up on the roof"
Good Morning Heartache,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Good morning, heartache, you ole gloomy sight
Good morning, heartache, thought we'd said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you
But you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning, heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin' around
Good morning, heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin' around
Good morning, heartache, sit down"
More Than You Know,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I've found you on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But darling, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry
How I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I show
More than you'll ever know"
Afro-Blue,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Dream of a land my soul is from
I hear a hand stroke on a drum
Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers are face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away
To some secluded place
Whispering trees echo their sighs
Passionate pleas, tender replies

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers in flight
Upward they climb
Burst at the height
Slowly subside
My slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it's not a dream
The two are you and me

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue"
Blue Rose,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Blue as the crying sky
With no thorn, and no thistle
Only an open face
Staring at the waking world

Maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

Her arms stretch wide
To receive life
And her roots go deep into the black earth for strength
And she blooms

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

She blooms while the people sleep
Only the travelers see her
To those who rise with the noon day sun
She is a closed mystery

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Oh, maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine"
Be-Bop Santa Claus,Babs Gonzales,Jazz,"Twas the blight before christmas
And all through the dawn
The scene was quiet except pop and mom
There sat hung in their big easy chair
Goofed on egg nog sherry and beer
Ces and lil jr, lie there in the bed
Whle visions of cadillacs jumped in their head
Moms jumped up and said pops lets quit it to bed
Then out on the stoop oweee such a clatter
Pops fled to the porthole to see what was the matter
He did a jump and fell back"

The Creator Has A Master Plan (Peace),Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"There was a time, when peace was on the earth,
And joy and happiness did reign and each man knew his worth
In my heart how I yearn for that spirit's return
And I cry, as time flies,
Om, Om

There is a place where love forever shines
And rainbows are the shadows of a presence so divine
And the glow of that love lights the heavens above
And it's free, can't you see, come with me

The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness for every man
The creator has a working plan
Peace and happiness for every man
The creator makes but one demand
Happiness through all the land"
Where Love Shines,Incognito,Jazz,"(J.P. Maunick / S. Grey)

People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
Everyday people looking for love
Yes they are searching

There's nothing in the world
Nothing else to be found, that can compare
With the power of love
Everyday we are yearning

Now gather together
>From every corner of the world
Let's open our minds to the light

People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me
It's no mystery

Let it rain on me, yeah

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
So much anger and pain, life's a game
That we're losing

Stop the masquerade
By the truth we are bound, and that's no lie
People crying for change
Everyday they are praying

Now gather together
>From every corner of the world
Let's open our minds to the light

Your love
Really wanna have it
Do you really dig it?
Really gotta get, get, get, get it"
Prayer Dance (Live),Rachelle Ferrell,Jazz,"Lift my knees from the ground
I will put my feet down
I will dance all my prayers
Unto God
With a swing and a sway
I will do it my way

Unto God

Do I stand for peace and love?
Yes I will... express myself to God in my dance
And when I pray I feel rhythm and song
That's why I dance all my prayers
Unto God"
Someone to watch over me,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me"

When I Fall In Love,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"When I fall in love it will be forever 
Or I'll never fall in love 
In a restless world like this is 
Love is ended before it's begun 
And too many moonlight kisses 
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely 
Or I'll never give my heart 
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I fall in love with you.

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I'll fall in love with you"
Do It Again,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"You really shouldn't have done it
You hadn't any right
I really shouldn't have let you
Kiss me
And although it was wrong
I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it
And you know you shouldn't have done it

Oh.
Do it again
I may say no, no, no, no, no
But do it again
My lips just ache
To have you take the kiss
That's waiting for you
You know if you do
You won't regret it
Come and get it.

Oh
No one is near
I may cry oh. Oh. oh. oh. oh.
But no one can hear.
Mamma may scold me
'Cause she told me
It was naughty but then

Please
Do it again
Yes do it again And again and again and again and again and again

And hold me close
In your arms
All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say
Goodbye and amen.

But until then
Please do it again"
I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"The snow is snowin'
The wind is blowin'

What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm"
Stranger In Paradise,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"Take my hand, 
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed, 
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside 
An angel like you
I saw your face, 
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended 
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms 
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"

It's About Time,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"Walking down to the water's edge
Where I have been before
If I don't find my love sometime
I'm walking out that door
Some may come and some may go
But no one seems to be
The person I've been searching for
The one who's meant for me

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely
Looking for her, my love my one and only
Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way
So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

When I'm making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cause it's about time

You try too hard and it feels just like
You're running on thin air
Why does luck happen by surprise
If you don't really care
The past is gone the flames are out
From fires that have burned
New ideals and different thoughts
From lessons I have learned

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely
Looking for her, my love my one and only
Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way
So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day
When I'm making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cause it's about time

Got the feeling this could take a pretty long while
To find that smile
Put my faith in another piece of good advice
Well I tried that twice
Waiting for, a little something more
To inspire, take me higher
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cause it's about time
It's about time"
Love For Sale,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work

The More I See You,Eliane Elias,Jazz,"The more I see you the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

The more I see you the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
The more I see you as years go by

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
The more I see you as years go by

The more I see you the more I want you
The more I see you the more I want you
The more I see you the more I want you"
My Broken Heart,Celso Fonseca,Jazz,"Alone under the stars
Along with my guitar
I'm about to give
All that love can take from you
My broken heart

Don't tell too many lies
Don't blame the moon
And please don't cry
I'm about to take
All that love can give steal from you
My broken heart

I only see blue moons
When I should see your eyes
It's for you the song
From my broken heart, I sing along
Under the stars

Doo dee, doo doo ...

I only see blue moons
When I should see your eyes
It's for you the song
From my broken heart, I sing along
Under the stars"
My Funny Valentine,Chet Baker,Jazz,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day"
I Love Being Here With You,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I love the East, I love the West
North and South, they're both the best
But I only want go there as a guest
'Cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more
You and they never be a bore
'Cause I love being here with you

Singing in the shower
Laughing by the hour
Life is such a breezy game
I love all kinds of weather
As long as we're together
Oh I love to hear you say my name

I love good wine, fine cuisine
Candle light I love the scene
Cause baby if you know just what I mean
I love being here with you

I love Ella singing, Basie's band is swinging
Cause that's something else you know
They know how to play it, they know how to say it
They just wind it up and let it go

Cary Grant through
Two time beggars but his charm just takes me away
But don't get me wrong how do you say
I love being here with you"
Serenity,Steve Cole,Jazz,"As I sit here and slowly close my eyes
I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my body
I'm the one in your soul
Reflecting inner light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner child

I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Tragic visions slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my time


I'm the one who loves you
No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner child

I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

I need serenity [x2]"
I Can't Give You Anything But Love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Scheme a while dream a while 
You're sure to find
Happiness and I guess

All those things you always pine for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworths doesn't sell, baby
Until that lucky day
You know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love"
Straighten Up And Fly Right,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air,
The monkey thought that everything 
Was on the square.
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey 
Off his back,
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, 
""Now listen, Jack..."" 

Straighten up and fly right,
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.
Ain't no use in divin',
What's the use in jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.

The buzzard told the monkey, 
You are chokin' me.
Release your hold and I'll set you free.
The monkey looked the buzzard right 
Dead in the eye and said,
Your story's so touching, but it sounds 
Just like a lie.

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.

Ain't no use in divin'
Ain't no good in jivin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow - your - top.

Fly right!"
I Will Be Blessed,Lisa Ekdahl,Jazz,"If the sun
Refused to shine
Down on me
Till the end of time
As long as I have your caress
Your tenderness
I will be blessed

If the stars
Refused their light
Just for me
They stayed out of sight
If you say you love me best
I won't care less
I will be blessed

If the wind won't blow your name
Until I'm still
I will
If it's whispered from above
The highest hill
I will

If the moon
Up in the sky
Turned its face
From the lonely eye
I could never be distressed
Or love you less
I will be blessed"
A Blossom Fell,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
The gypsies say and I know why
""A falling blossom only touches lips that lie.""

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied"
Broken,Norah Jones,Jazz,"He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile
Guess he's been that way for quite a while
Got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim
Did he do it to himself or was it done to him?

People say that he don't look well
But all he needs from what I can tell
Is someone to help wash away all the paint
From his purple hands before it gets too late

I saw him stand alone
Under a broken street light
So sincere ... singing silent night
But the trees were full
And the grass was green
It was the sweetest thing I had ever seen

He may move slow
But that don't mean he's going nowhere
He may be moving slow
But that don't mean he's going nowhere"

Come Dance With Me,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots
And come dance with me
Come dance with me, what an evenin' for some terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place
Come on, dance with me

Romance with me cross a crowded floor
And while the rhythm swings
What lovely things I'll be sayin'
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love
Set to music... Playin'

When the band begins to leave the stand
Folks start to roam
As we waltz home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me"
When The Saints Go Marching In,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"We are trav'ling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

O when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

O when the trumpet sounds the call
O when the trumpet sounds the call
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in"
A Beautiful Friendship,Susannah McCorkle,Jazz,"This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
It ended a moment ago.
This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
I know,
For your eyes told me so.

We were always
Like sister and brother,
Until tonight,
When we looked at each other.

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of lov&101

(Instrumental interlude)

We were always
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love

That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love.

That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love!"

It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),The Mills Brothers,Jazz,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It makes no diff'rence
If it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm
Ev'rything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing

Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)"
Easy Street,Julie London,Jazz,"Easy street, I'd love to live on easy street
Nobody works on easy street
Just lie around all day, just sit and play the horses

Life is sweet for folks who live on easy street
No weekly payments you must meet
That makes your hair turn gray

When opportunity comes knockin'
You just keep on with your rockin'
'Cause you know your fortune's made

And if the sun makes you perspire
There's a man that you can hire
To plant trees so you can have shade

On easy street, I'm telling everyone I meet
If I could live on easy street I'd want no job today
So please, go 'way"
When I Look In Your Eyes,Diana Krall,Jazz,"When I look in your eyes, I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes 
I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes 
When I look in your eyes 

And it is no surprise, to see the softness of the moon in your eyes 
The gentle sparkle of the stars in your eyes 
When I look in your eyes 

In your eyes, I see the deepness of the sea 
I see the deepness of the love 
The love I feel you feel for me 

Autumn comes, summer dies 
I see the passing of the years in your eyes 
And when we part there will be no tears no goodbyes 
I'll just look into your eyes 

Those eyes, so wise 
So warm, so real 
How I love the world, your eyes reveal"
Nightmoves,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"The music begins and the tidals fade in
Starring you and me
The hero is struggling to say, that his lady is far away
In her prison of wishes

We're loving, we fight but it's all day for night
Just to masquerade
We're reel till the red light is off, then we go, take our faces off
Like two clowns in a side show

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Just another Technicolor, role man's on the screen
Love is like two dreamers dreaming the same dream
Just another Technicolor, romance, romance on the screen

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Just another Technicolor, romance on the screen

I keep you in frame and I whisper your name
Till the picture fades
The feeling is already gone, I don't know why I'm going on
Can't remember the ending

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Love is like two dreamers
Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Love is like, love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream"
Don't Make Me Wait For Love,Kenny G,Jazz,"Sitting here, just staring at your picture
Waiting for your call
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion
We could have it all

Time and time again you tell me to be patient
But we can't let love slip away

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Ooh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Hmm, I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness
Fall asleep alone
Give me a sign, a man ain't supposed to face life
Standing on his own

When you're near me, I can't help but see forever
Come and rescue me tonight

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Can't you see I need your love? I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, yeah
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Oh, oh, oh, baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Can't you see I need your love? I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find, ooh, baby
Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, I need you, baby
I love you, I need you, I want you, baby"
Alison,Holly Cole,Jazz,"Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, now
The way you look I understand
That you were not impressed
I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you've were loving some body
I only know it isn't mine
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Alison, my aim is true

I see you've got a husband now
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand
I'll bet he took all that he could take
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way

Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true
My aim is true"

Russian Lullaby,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Where the dreamy Volga flows
There's a lonely Russian Rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
Listen

Ev'ry night you'll hear her croon
A Russian lullaby


Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry

Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

A land that's free for you and me
And a Russian lullaby"
I Wished On The Moon,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"Every night was long and gloomy, shadows gathered in the air
No one ever listened to me, no one wondered did I care
None in all the world to love me, none to count that stars that hung
Then the moon came out above me and I saw that it was young

I wished on the moon for something I never knew
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April day that would not dance away

I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two
Wished on a star and asked for a dream or two
I looked for ev'ry loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you"
Street Life,The Crusaders,Jazz,"I still hang around neither lost nor found
Hear the lonely sound of music in the night
Nights are always bright
That's all that's left for me, yeah
I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only way I know
Street life
And there's a thousand cards to play
Until you play your life away
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are
Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel, for a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep t young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon
Street life, street life, street life, oh street life..."
I've got a crush on you,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Hmm I've got a crush on someone. Guess who
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All day and night time give me sign
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush my baby on you

How glad the million ralish from millionairs to carish
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you"
My One and Only Love,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all of your splendor
My one and only love

Shadow's fall and spreads their mystique charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender, yes
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
Blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tell me that you in my own [Incomprehensible]

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender, babe
My one and only love

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender, babe
My one and only love yes

My one and my only love"
Two Sleepy People,Fats Waller,Jazz,"Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning, look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
Too much in love to say, ""Goodnight""

Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
Much, too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all, but I was crazy about you baby
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are, just about the same
Foggy little fella, dizzy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
Much, too much in love to say, ""Goodnight""
Goodnight"
Mixtape,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"Everything I know is you
Let me tell you what we're listening to
I'm a gentle soul I'm sure
But on the stereo I'm a dictator
Do you even have a tape machine?
To facilitate my plastic dreams
All the things that I have seen, from
Morrissey to John Coltrane Ah!...
Cinematic Orchestra, De La Soul the Shangri-La's
An adolescent love letter, a sparkling jewel of manual labour

I'll make you a mixtape that's a blueprint of my soul
It may sound grand but babe it's all you need to know
I'll make you a mixtape that will charm you into bed
It details everything that's running round my head

That's running round my head

Fondling, record and play
Without you it's records night and day

This ain't no disc of MP3's
This one' handmade, fashioned lovingly

Plant the rhythm in your bones
You're the only angel in headphones
My love can paint a million tones
From Nine Inch Nails to Louis Armstrong
So resurrect your stereo
And the swathrs of melodies will flow
Thelonious, Maurizio
I tell you babe it will make my heart glow

I'll make you mixtape that's a blueprint of my soul
It may sound grand but babe it's all you need to know
I'll make you a mixtape that will charm you into bed
It details everything that's running round my head"
Lady Sings The Blues,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Lady sing the blues,
She's got them bad,
She feels so sad.

And wants the world to know,
Just what her blues are all about,

Lady sings the blues,
She tells her side,
Nothing to hide.

Now the world will know,
Just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
When you get a bad start,
When you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
I know I won't die,
'Cause I love him

Lady sings the blues,
I'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad,
But now the world will know,
She's never gonna sing them no more.

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart,
When you get a bad start,
When you and your man have to part

Ain't gonna just sit around and cry,

Night And Day,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon AND under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And ITS torment won't be through
'TIL you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day"
Broken,Norah Jones,Jazz,"He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile

Lucky To Be Me,Blossom Dearie,Jazz,"What a day,
Fortune smiled and came my way,
Bringing love I never thought I'd see,
I'm so lucky to be me.
What a night,
Suddenly you came in sight,
Looking just the way I'd hoped you'd be,
I'm so lucky to be me.
I am simply thunderstruck
At the change in my luck:
Knew at once I wanted you,
Never dreamed you'd want me, too.
I'm so proud
You chose me from all the crowd,
There's no other guy I'd rather be,
I could laugh out loud,
I'm so lucky to be me."
I Will Survive,The Puppini Sisters,Jazz,"I Will Survive

First I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to carry on
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I
I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I will stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
Now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me"
Tranquil Flight,Beady Belle,Jazz,"Tell me a tale
And lull me to sleep
I'll walk into the vale
Of wonderland so deep

Let me escape
To gain upon my hope
And let me through the gate
Into the world of thought

Sleep inducing phrases in your lullaby
Tell me I am airborne, to fairyland I fly
Sit at my bedside just one more time
Stroke me down, give me peace of mind
Rock me till I'm leaving reality behind

Sleepy ideas
Is giving me a drive
My soothing fantasies
The reason I survive

Draw the Venetian blinds
And hide what hurts to see
We're running out of time
Defined by you and me"
He Loves And She Loves,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"He loves and she loves,
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love,
And that's what we both should do.

Oh I always knew someday you'd come along,
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?

Oh I always knew someday you'd come along,
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?
Won't you love me, as I love you?

Original Version:
Peter:
Now that I have found you
I must hang around you.
Though you may refuse me,
You will never lose me.
If the human race is
Full of happy faces -

Frankie:
It's because they all love
That wonderous thing they call love.

Peter:
He loves and she loves,
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?

Frankie:
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love,
And that's what we both should do.

Peter:
Oh I always knew someday you'd come along,

Frankie:
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
Hear me

Peter:
He loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?

Frankie:
Feel a funny feeling
In my heart a-stealing;
If it's love, I'm for it.
Gosh! How I adore it!
You're the silver lining
For which I've been pining.

Peter:
Lonesome days are over;
From now on, we're in clover.

Repeat refrain."
Cheek To Cheek,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek"
I Don't Know Enough About You,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you
Just when I think you're mine you try a different line
Baby what can I do

I read the latest news
No buttons on my shoes
Baby I'm confused about you
You've got me in a spin
And what a spin I'm in
'Cause I don't know enough about you

Jack of all trades
Master of none
And isn't it a shame
I'm so sure that you'de be good for me
If you'de only play my game

You know I went to school
And I'm nobody's fool
That is to say until I met you
I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you

Jack of all trades
Master of none
And isn't it a shame
I'm so sure that you'de be good for me
If you'de only play my game

You know I went to school
And I'm nobody's fool
That is to say until I met you
I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you

I know a bit about biology
A little more about psychology
I'm a little gem in geology
But I don't know enough about you
No, I don't know enough about you
No, I don't know enough about you"
Solitaire,Nina Simone,Jazz,"Carl Nutter, Renee Borek, King Guion 

Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,
Dealing out the cards from left to right,
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

And until you want to share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire."
You,Pieces Of A Dream,Jazz,"I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would
And baby it's you

The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
(You)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night
(You)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth

Next year let's call this day our anniversary
The day I put my heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on
Say that you'll always be mine
Cause girl whe I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mine
And baby it's you

The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile

The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,Les Brown,Jazz,Instrumental
Alfie,Trijntje Oosterhuis,Jazz,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?

Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel

And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in

I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie"
Moonlight Cocktail,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"Couple of jiggers of moonlight and add a star
Pour in the blue of a June night and one guitar
Mix in a couple of dreamers, and there you are
Lovers hail the Moonlight Cocktail

Now add a couple of flowers, a drop of dew
Stir for a couple of hours till dreams come true
And to the number of kisses, it's up to you
Moonlight Cocktail, need a  few

Cool it in the summer breeze
Serve it in the starlight underneath the trees
You'll discover tricks like these
Are sure to make your Moonlight Cocktail please

Follow the simple directions and they will bring
Life of another complexion where you'll be king
You will awake in the morning and start to sing
Moonlight Cocktails are the thing

(Follow the simple directions and they will bring)
(Life of another complexion where you'll be king)
You will awake in the morning and start to sing
Moonlight Cocktails are the thing"
Every Time She Whispers,Michael Franks,Jazz,"There isn't any part of me she does not know
We've been together about a thousand years or so
Still almost instantly my love begins to show
Every time she whispers

It makes no difference if I'm down upon my luck
When she invites me in, my gloom becomes unstuck
I feel the barriers around me deconstruct
Every time she whispers

Tensions dissolve when we touch
In her arms the world is erased when it's too much
All of my deep blue disappears
As soon as I hear her whisper

Passion evolves when we touch
In her arms I measure success counting how much
Music she composes in sighs
And how many times she whispers my name

She whispers my name

Love is the weakness that we need to make us strong
How can a hundred million Frenchmen all be wrong?
And I'm completely at the mercy of her song
Every time she whispers

Tensions dissolve when we touch
In her arms the world is erased when it's too much
All of my deep blue disappears
As soon as I hear her whisper

Passion evolves when we touch
In her arms I measure success counting how much
Music she composes in sighs
And how many times she whispers my name

Tensions dissolve when we touch
In her arms the world is erased when it's too much
All of my deep blue disappears
As soon as I hear her whisper

Passion evolves when we touch
In her arms I measure success counting how much
Music she composes in sighs
And how many times she whispers my name

She whispers my name

Inside
Every time she whispers
High tide
Cannot be tamed

Of course
Every time she whispers
Love force
Rages unchained

Inside
Every time she whispers
High tide
Cannot be tamed

Of course
Every time she whispers
Love force
Rages unchained"
It's a Sin To Tell a Lie,Fats Waller,Jazz,"Be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of heart have been broken
Just because these words were spoken

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie

Now, ya better be sure that it's true when you say ""I love ya.""
Honey chile, don'tcha know it's a sin to tell a lie? Whole lotta hearts have been
Broken. Ya know why they were broken? Just for these foolish little words that
Were spoken. Ya know what they were? ""I love ya, I love ya."" Darlin', ya know
Doggone well I LUV ya and if ya break my heart I've GOT to die. So ya better be
Sure that it's true when you come runnin' up here sayin' ""I love ya"" 'cause it's a sin
To tell a lie.

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie"
Gentle Rain,Astrud Gilberto,Jazz,"We both are lost and alone in the world
Walk with me in the gentle rain
Don't be afraid, I've a hand for your hand
And I will be your love for a while

I feel your tears, as they fall on my cheek
They are warm like the gentle rain
Come little one, you've got me in the world
And our love will be sweet, very sweet

Come little one, you've got me in the world
And our love will be sweet
Very sweet, very sad
Like the gentle rain
Like the gentle rain"
How High The Moon,Dianne Reeves,Jazz,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Until it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Until it comes true
That you love me as I love you

She's Funny That Way,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see
Just glad I'm livin' and happy to be
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She'd never holler, she'd live in a tent
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

Though she'd love to work 
And slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off 
If I went away

But why should I leave her, why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

(Instrumental)

When I hurt her feelin's once in a while
Her only answer is one little smile
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way"
Here's To Life,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"No complaints
And no regrets
I still believe in chasing dreams
And placing bets
But I have learned
That all you give
Is all you get
So give it all you've got

I had my share
I drank my fill
And even though I'm satisfied
I'm hungry still
To see what's down another road
Beyond the hill
And do it all again

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Funny how the time just flies
How love can go
From warm hellos
To sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories
You've memorized
To keep your winters warm

For there's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings
Or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game
I want to play
For laughs
For life
For love

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
Here's to life
For dreamers and their dreams

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
Here's to life
Here's to love
Here's to you

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
Here's to life
Here's to love
Here's to you"
Blue Alert,Madeleine Peyroux,Jazz,"There's perfume burning in the air
Bits of beauty everywhere
Shrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt

She comes so close
You feel her then
She tells you No and No again
Your lip is cut on the edge of her pleated skirt
Blue Alert

Visions of her drawing near
Arise, abide, and disappear
You try to slow it down
It doesn't work

It's just another night I guess
All tangled up in nakedness
You even touch yourself
You're such a flirt
Blue Alert

You know how nights like this begin
The kind of knot your heart gets in
Any way you turn is going to hurt


There's perfume burning in the air
Bits of beauty everywhere
Shrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt
Blue Alert

She breaks the rules so you can see
She's wilder than you'll ever be
You talk religion but she won't convert

Her body's twenty stories high
You try to look away, you try
But all you want to do is get there first
Blue Alert

You know how nights like this begin
The kind of knot your heart gets in
Any way you turn is going to hurt

There's perfume burning in the air
Bits of beauty everywhere
Shrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt
Blue Alert
Blue Alert..."
The Long Day Is Over,Norah Jones,Jazz,"Feeling tired
By the fire
The long day
Is over

Asleep at dawn
The embers
Burn on

With no reprise
The sun will rise

Is over"
Puttin' On The Ritz,Fred Astaire,Jazz,"Have you seen the well-to-do, up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare, with their noses in the air
High hats and Arrow collars, white spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime, for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits,
Puttin' on the ritz.

Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, perfect fits,
Puttin' on the ritz.

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying mighty hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)

Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or ""umberellas"" in their mitts,
Puttin' on the ritz.

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits,
(Puttin' on the ritz)

(Puttin' on the ritz"
Little Room,Norah Jones,Jazz,"You an' me and
Me and you
In my little room
There's room enough for us to do
The things we like to do

Oops, I hit my elbow on the doorknob
Its right there
It's by the bed next to my head
But I don't even care

There's stars up on the wall
And they all glow in the dark
And we can hear the children playing
Outside in the park

There's bars on the window
And if there were a fire
We'd burn up for sure
But that's just fine by me 'cause
We would be together ever more

In this little room
In the big city we're so far
From the people that we knew in
My big ol' blue car

But if we stick together
Then I know we'll be ok
'Cause when it gets too cold outside
This room is where we'll stay"
I'm Beginning To See the Light,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light"
Testify,Dianne Reeves,Jazz,"Sometimes you won't understand why life is the way it is
Things don't always go the way you plan them
But I believe, God and time are synonymous
And in time God reveals all things
Be still, stand in love, pay attention

I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify

When I look back on my life
I shudder when I think of the danger I put myself in
But amazing grace always carried me to safety
Knowing that I'd go back to the same place again and again
No one could ever love me, the way that you do
In spirit, mind and body I surrender myself daily to you

I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just gotta testify

So sweet the journey when you learn to love yourself, accept yourself
Forgive yourself, respect yourself, believe in yourself, be yourself
With amazing grace as your constant friend
I am free of anger, I am free of fear, and my mind is at ease
I don't regret yesterday, 'cause yesterday made me who I am today

I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just gotta testify
Amazing grace saved my Life

I just wanna testify
Oh amazing grace saved my life
Saved my life, saved my life
I just gotta testify"
Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Inkspots:
Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart
Some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts

Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Ella:
Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much, too much, is fallin' in mine
Into each heart, some tears must fall
But someday- the sun will shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts

Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine

Inkspots:
Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is falling into mine
And into each heart- some tears gotta fall
But, I know, that some day that sun is bound to shine

Together:
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine"
My Own Best Friend,Liza Minnelli,Jazz,"One thing I know
And I've always known
I am my own best friend
Baby's alive
But baby's alone
And baby's her own best friend

Many's the kind
Who told me he cares
But they were scratchin' my back
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs...

And trusting too
That's only for fools
I play the game
When I make the rules
And rule number one
From here to the end
Is I am my own best friend

I am my own best friend

Baby's her own best friend
Three muskateers
Who never said die
Are standing here this minute
Me, myself, and I...

Life is a school
I'll pass every test
If life is a game
I'll play it the best
'Cause I won't give in
And I'll never bend
And I am my own - best - frie-iend..."
The Itch,Belleruche,Jazz,"No I don't think you understand
What I'm looking for, what I yearn for
What I say, who I am and what I stand for
No, no, no

I will not agree, just to keep your peace
Hope you won't agree just to stay with me
It can't be any other way

Even if you
Even if you shift me to the east
Raise me to the north
And drown me in the south
What's left to explore

Don't deny me
I've got your number
I know where you live
Don't refuse me
I know what you need
And just how much to give
Shall I give you what I think you need
Will you let me rack up what I feel
Is good for you, what is good for you
What is good for you

No I'm not asking for
Your undivided twenty four
I need much more than that
Such is the necessity I give more just to receive
But it's the respect I've go to feel
I can't compromise this need
Same as my desire to feel

Even if you
Even if you shift me to the east
Raise me to the north
And drown me in the south
What's left to explore

Don't deny me
I've got your number
I know where you live
Don't refuse me
I know what you need
And just how much to give
Shall I give you what I think you need
Will you let me rack up what I feel
Is good for you, what is good for you
What is good for you

No I don't think you understand
I couldn't talk to you for a week
Out of disappointment and sadness you let me down
And I yearn for you still
Just miss you around

Don't deny me
I've got your number
I know where you live
Don't refuse me
I know what you need
And just how much to give
Shall I give you what I think you need

Angel Eyes,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Pardon me but I got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Oh, where is my angel eyes

Excuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes, angel eyes"
My man,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore"
My Foolish Heart,Susannah McCorkle,Jazz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart"
The Man I Love,Peggy Lee,Jazz,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best
To make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both
Won't say a word

Maybe
I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure
To meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday
Will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'd never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting
For the man I love"
Americano,The Brian Setzer Orchestra,Jazz,"He's drivin' a jeep

Never seen a horse

He wants to drive a Cadillac
Now he's chasing showgirls
Smokin' Camels, whiskey and soda
Now he's never goin' back

He's cruisin streets for gold
Dressed in designer clothes

You'd better not blink
Or you'll wind up in the drink

'Cause that's his baby's
Favorite thing

Anything can happen
Reach for the stars
Grab that golden ring
Just remember he's Americano
Well watch it pal
'Cause he'll take everything

Americano, Americano
He wants to drive a Cadillac
Now he's chasing showgirls
Smokin' Camels, whiskey and soda
Now he's never goin' back

He likes that rock and roll
He's playing baseball
Loves Marilyn Monroe
A coca cola Joe
And a pizza pie to go

Wanna be Americano Americano, Americano
Gotta buy a diamond ring
'Cause that's his baby's
Favorite thing
Okay, all right, yeah man

Wanna be American
Wanna be American

Jump For Joy,Duke Ellington And His Orchestra,Jazz,"Fare thee well land of cotton.
Cotton lisle is out of style,
Honey chile
Jump for Joy
DOn't you grieve little Eve
All the hounds I do believe
Have been killed
Ain't 'cha thrilled?
Jump for Joy
Have you seen pastures groovy?
Green pastures was just a technicolor movie
When you stomp up to heaven and you meet old Saint Pete
Tell that boy
""Jump for joy""
Step right in
Give Pete some skin and
Jump for Joy"
On The Sunny Side Of The Street,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street.

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street.

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over.

If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller.
Gonna set my feet
On the sunny side of the street.

Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street.

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Live can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street.

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over.

If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street."
Don't Smoke In Bed,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said
 
Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed
 
Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed"
The Smile Of A Child,Incognito,Jazz,"There's no song like a love song
(Love song)
No love like true love
(True love)
No smile
Like the smile of a child

Be like a child
Welcome each day one at a time
Don't be a afraid
(Do be do do be do)
To say you're sorry when you're wrong
Be a better you
Be like a child



Be like a child
Don't lose yourself in a world of cares
Let yourself go
(Do be do do be do)
Oh, be happy and be loved
Be a better you
Be like a child

Be like a child
Welcome each day...
And, don't lose yourself..."
In The Morning,Norah Jones,Jazz,"I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can't stop myself from falling
Falling back again
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

Dark like the shady corner
Inside a violin
Hot like to burn my lips
I know I can't win
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

I tried to quit you but I'm too weak
Waking up without you
I can hardly speak at all

My girlfriend tried to help me
Get you off my mind
She tried a little tea and sympathy
To help me to unwind
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

Funny how my favorite shirt
Smells like you more than me
Bitter traces left behind
In stains no one can see
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

You're gonna put me in an early grave
I know I'm your slave whenever you call

I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can stop myself from falling
Falling back again
Falling back again
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon"
Sad Song,Room Eleven,Jazz,"Does it have to be a sad song?
Isn't it a shame?
The ones I try the hardest with
Never stay the same

And I just can't decide if it's good or bad
The times I hold the dearest are the times we never had

We've yet to have

We've yet to have

And isn't it a sad song,
It's some jazz
How perfectly we fit today,
What yesterday we passed

And I just can't consider another in your place
Holding another hand, seeing another face

We've only had

We've only had

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame, oh it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

It is a goodbye song
It is time for the blues
Stomp away through shallow puddles
In your water walking shoes

We only had one exquisite corpse
Over ginger and Pim's,
And the kind of back scratching
That doesn't brake skin

But we will have, oh I know it!
We will have, oh I know it!

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame, oh it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

We will have, I know it!
We will have, oh"
For The Love of You,Candy Dulfer,Jazz,"Hey baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me
Yeah yeah yeah

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
Well, when you're loving me, ooh baby

Love to be, riding the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch
It seems to me, we can sail together
In and out of mystery

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Paradise, I have to think
Can't feel as secure again
You're the key and this I see

Now and then I lose my way
Usin' words to try
And say what I feel

Oh yeah, your love is real
I might as well sign my name on a card
That's been sayin' better

See, time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done
Just about all that I can do

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you"
Elmer's Tune,Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,Jazz,"Why are the stars always winkin'
And blinkin' above?
What makes a fella start thinkin'
Of fallin' in love?

It's not the season
The reason
It's plain as the moon
It's just Elmer's tune

What makes a lady of eighty
Go out on the loose?
Why does a gander meander
In search of a goose?

What puts the kick in
A chicken?
The magic in June?
It's just Elmer's tune

Listen, listen
There's a lot you're liable to be missin'
Sing it, swing it
Any ol' way and any ol' time

The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies
The cop on the beat
The candy maker, the baker
The man on the street

The city charmer
The farmer
The man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies
The cop on the beat
The banker 
And the man on the street

The city charmer
The farmer
The man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

They all sing Elmer's tune
They all sing Elmer's tune"
I've Got a Crush on You,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you"
Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think),Guy Lombardo,Jazz,"You work and work for years and years, you're always on the go
You never take a minute off, too busy makin' dough
Someday you say, you'll have your fun, when you're a millionaire
Imagine all the fun you'll have in your old rockin' chair

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by, as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

You're gonna take that ocean trip, no matter come what may
You've got your reservations made, but you just can't get away
Next year for sure, you'll see the world, you'll really get around
But how far can you travel when you're six feet underground?

Your heart of hearts, your dream of dreams, your ravishing brunette
She's left you and she's now become somebody else's pet
Lay down that gun, don't try my friend to reach the great beyond
You'll have more fun by reaching for a redhead or a blond

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by, as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

You never go to night clubs and you just don't care to dance
You don't have time for silly things like moonlight and romance
You only think of dollar bills tied neatly in a stack
But when you kiss a dollar bill, it doesn't kiss you back

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by, as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think"
I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart,Jane Monheit,Jazz,"There ain't no use in me trying to tell you how I feel
'Cause what I feel ain't what you're feeling
I don't know what we did wrong, I just know if you come home
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again

There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been
'Cause where you've been ain't where I'm going
'Cause if I ask you where you've been the hurting starts and it don't end
So I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, I ain't gonna let you break my heart again

Tears don't become me, pain ain't my friend
It seems like you enjoy my crying, baby
You always said that I was strong, I believe that you were wrong
Lately God knows I have been trying

There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt, baby
'Cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding
If you decide you're coming home when you walk in, it won't be like before
'Cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, oh no, oh no, no, no

Tears don't become me, pain ain't my friend
It seems like you enjoy my crying, baby
You always said that I was strong, I believe that you were wrong
Lately God knows I have been trying

There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt, baby
'Cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding
If you decide you're coming home when you walk in, it won't be like before
'Cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, ain't gonna let you break my heart again, oh no, no"

Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,Lena Horne,Jazz,"Oh listen, sister, I love my Mr. Man
And I can't tell you why there ain't no reason
For me to love dat man
It must be sumthin' dat the angels done plan

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly
I got to love one man till I die
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine

Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine

When he goes away dat's a rainy day
But when he comes back dat day is fine
The sun will shine

He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine"
Learnin' The Blues,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"The tables are empty - the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song - it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning - just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson - in learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light - one after another
Won't help you forget her - and the way that you love her
You're only burning - a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track - for learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you - constantly
When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep - the whole night you're crying
You just can't forget her - soon you even stop trying
You'll walk the floor - and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break - you're learnin' the (those) blues"

Before Too Long,Jazzamor,Jazz,"(Mary applegate, roland grosch, bettina mischke, helfried wildenhain)
(Inverness/Scotland)

One day in spring you flap your wings you fly away
On borrowed time and realize something's on your mind
You wonder when the journey ends
And will you find the way

Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself yourself again

Reflections in a moving train you're far from home
You see the sky just passing by never to return
And in a field it seemed so real
A girl lies all alone

Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself yourself again

You walk and walk, and wonder where
Now is she really there

Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself again
Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself yourself again"
Scootcha-Booty,Al Jarreau,Jazz,"Number one is the clock track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin' the pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in the distance runnin' darlin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

Stumblers stumblin' they gonna stumble on it
Bumblers bumlin' will bumble 'til they've found it
No more slumberin' get out from under darlin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

I seen some lessons in that new school, so cool
You never laugh or smile or grin
The same expression if they boo you
Now if that ain't the time to laugh you've gotta tell me when

Paint some flowers on your wagon
To help yourself to laugh and grin
Pick up them trousers kid they're saggin'
And don't bite snap when you rap and someone will let you in

Number on is the track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin' the pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in the distance runnin' darlin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

Computers workin' but I'm starvin'
I'd to show it how to sweat
Before it's over we'll be farmin'
You know that just might be the best thing to happen yet

Number one is the track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin' the pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Somethin's comin' to get you up and runnin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move"
Dedicated to You,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"If I should write a book for you
That brought me fame and fortune too
That book would be like my heart, my soul
And me dedicated to you

And if I should paint a picture too
That showed the loveliness and the brilliance of you
My art would be like my heart
And me dedicated to you

To you because your love is the beacon
That lights up my way
To you because with you I know
A lifetime could be just one heavenly day

If I should find one twinkling star
One half as wondrous as you are
That star would be like my heart
And me dedicated, dedicated to you

To you for your love is the beacon of light
That brightens up my day
With you I know I'd live a lifetime of love
In a heavenly way, every heavenly day

For if I should find one lucky star
One half as lucky as you are
That star would be like my heart
And me dedicated to you, all for you

Dedicated to you, all for you and given to you
Dedicated to you"
Laura,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The LAUGH that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura
But she's only a dream"
The Nearness Of You,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft light to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
The nearness of you"
Deeper Than You Think,George Benson,Jazz,Instrumental
Flame,Al Jarreau,Jazz,"So close and yet so smart
Head first before the heart
Ain't no shame
Ain't no game
With the flame

Coldwaters rush in March
No place for April flowers
Take her name
Say she came
With the flame

I've been told
When the stars all align
That even bitter lips like mine
Will call the moon a friend and kiss again
Some I'm told
Let their hearts read the signs
While other men are hungerin
And can't let it in

Be still my foolish heart
Please don't upset the cart
Stay the same
Ain't no game
With the flame

I've been told
I'll be dancin in time
Walkin' rhythm talkin' rhyme
The earth will turn and send the sun again
All my gold
For a light or a sign
Some kind of kin
To say my friend
Let it out - let it in

Strange fire down below
So 'fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame

Strange fire down below
So fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame
The flame (2x)"
Prelude To A Kiss,Duke Ellington,Jazz,"If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss
If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony -
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh! How my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss.
If you hear a song in blue

A prelude to a kiss."
Laughing At Life,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
Smile through your tears, laughing at liife
No road is lonely, if you will only
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Smile through your tears, laugh at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life"
Stormy Weather,Lena Horne,Jazz,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky,
Stormy weather,
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time.

Life is bare,
Gloom and misery everywhere,
Stormy weather,
Just can't get my poor self together,
I'm weary all the time, the time.
So weary all the time.

When he went away, the blues walked in and met me,
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me,
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more.

Can't go on,
All I have in life is gone,
Stormy weather,
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time.
Keeps rainin' all the time.

I walk around, heavy-hearted and sad,
Night comes around, I'm still feelin' bad,
Rain pourin' down, blindin' every hope I had,
This pitterin', patterin', beatin' and spatterin' drives me mad!
Love, love, love, love!
This misery is just too much for me!

Can't go on,
Everything I had is gone,
Stormy weather,
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time,
Keeps rainin' all the time."
Jim,Sarah Vaughan,Jazz,"Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get feelin' low
I say let's call it quits
Then I hang on and let him go 
Breakin' my heart in bits

Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me
But even if he does you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim

I'll go on lovin' my Jim"
Jeepers Creepers,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get them peepers?
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh oh, git up
How'd they get so lit up?
Gosh oh, gee oh
How'd they get that size?

Golly gee
When you turn them heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers, creepers
Where'd ya get them peepers
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize

Jeepers, creepers
Where'd your get them peepers
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize
Where did your get those

Where did your get them there eyes?"
Without Your Love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Without your love
I'm like a song without words
Just like a nest without birds
Without your love
Fine sun above
Will never shine at my door
My life holds nothing in store
Without your love
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

I've rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love"
Daylight Is Short In Fall,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, ""Baby can't you see?""
""Baby understand?""
""Baby you're for me""
""Oh won't you take my hand?""
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Man I held so tight
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time
Baby, baby all the time"
Hallelujah,Chris Botti,Jazz,Instrumental
Alone Together,Chet Baker,Jazz,"Can't stand your present job, afraid of getting fired
Depressed? Staring at the0late night tube
You could call that number
But you'd just get someone just like you

Well, I feel that way too
Just the same as you
Like it's getting worse before it's getting better
I've got troubles of my own
But as long as you're alone
Stick with me and we'll be alone""together

Beer is warm, dinner's cold and greasy
Even when life isn't hard it always seems uneasy
All alone, nobody""seems to care
Everybody's got some place
And you don't fit in anywhere

You wonder, will you always have to live in doubt
Sometimes you feel just
Like Hank Williams used to sing about
Through the window, the night's so still
And if you listen you can hear
That lonesome whippoorwill

Can't stand your present job, afraid of getting fired
Depressed? Staring at the0late night tube"
I Got It Bad,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The good book says ""go seek and ye shall find""
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;
In emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him.

Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him, nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!"
I'll Chase The Blues Away,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I'll chase the blues away
I'll laugh and sing all day
I've found my lover, someone who'll be true

The blue birds in a tree
Will sing their song to me
For they'll discover I'm no longer blue

I've travelled far
In search of someone like you
For what you are
Is the dream that I've prayed would soon come true

I'll chase the blues away
I'll print some news today
I've found my lover, someone who'll be true"
Send One Your Love,Boney James,Jazz,"Send her your love with a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it with a flower from your heart
Show him your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's straight from your heart

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
Waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion

Send her your love with a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it with a flower from your heart
Show him your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's straight from the heart

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory

Send one your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's coming from your heart, whoa whoa
From your heart, whoa whoa, from your heart, whoa whoa

Send one your love, show him your love
Send one your love, your love"
The Real Thing,Bebel Gilberto,Jazz,"Looking forward to seeing you
My, it's been such a long, long time
Looking forward to feeling you
Love has been so heavy on my mind
On my mind, all the time
On my mind

Had a chance to look forward
To be part of your love in my dreams
But I can't be happy with
Fantasizing instead of the real thing
The real thing, not my dreams
The real thing

There are no words
That can express the way
I feel today
'Cause I feel today
Like no other day
Longing more and more
For your loving

There are no songs
That I can sing
To ease my troubled mind
'Cause my troubled mind
Will be a troubled blue
Until you say
You're coming home to me

So let me hear you sweet baby
Let me hear you say the words
Send your love in a hurry
Send it's melody by a love bird
A love bird, send your word
By a love bird

There are no words
That can express the way
I feel today
'Cause I feel today
Like no other day
Longing more and more
For your loving

There is no other someone
That can ease my achin' heart
'Cause my achin' heart
Told my troubled mind
The only remedy to its pain
Is your love

Let me hear you say, baby
Everything's gonna be all right
Stop my heart from achin'
Stop my eyes from cryin'
Through the night
Through the night, I won't cry
Through the night"
In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning,Johnny Hartman,Jazz,"In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never even think of counting sheep

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most

When the sun is high in the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on
Something happens to you

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
That's the time you miss her most of all"
The Night We Called It A Day,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day
Soft through the dark


The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than i
The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day"
Bell Bottom Trousers,Guy Lombardo,Jazz,"Once there was a little girl who lived next to me
And she loved a sailor boy, he was only three
Now he's on a battleship in his sailor suit
Just a great big sailor but she thinks he's very cute

With his bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
She loves her sailor and he loves her too

When her sailor boy's away on the ocean blue
Soldier boys all flirt with her but to him she's true
Though they smile and tip their caps and they wink their eyes
She just smiles and shakes her head, then she softly sighs

Oh, bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
She loves her sailor and he loves her too

When her sailor went to sea to see what he could see
She saw that he ate spinach, now he's big as he can be
When he's home they stroll along, they don't give a hoot
She won't let go of his hand, even to salute

If her sailor she can't find on the bounding main
She is hopeful he will soon come home safe again
So they can get married and raise a family
Dress up all their kiddies in sailor's dungarees

Oh, bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
She loves her sailor and he loves her too"
Yours,Sara Gazarek,Jazz,"You push,
You shove
You do all that you can
And time, it slips away
Everything will keep it some place
And all that I say

When the distance
Keeps us distant.
You know I'll always think about you
Even when I'm
Not all there
The love I have is yours.
Baby it's yours

You sit
You wait
You do all you can
And life, it fades away
But don't forget
The soul that you have
And all that we say

Dark days come and
Bright ones go out
But you will always make it better
People see it
And I feel it
The love I have, baby it's yours
It's yours

Forget the things that people say to try to hurt you
Forget their fears that overtake them in their lives
Forget this world with all it's petty disappointments
But don't forget that your the lovely person I love so.

Dark days come in
Bright ones go out
But you will always make it better
People see it
And I feel it
The love I have is yours.
It's yours.

Ooh..."
Christmas Is Coming,Vince Guaraldi Trio,Jazz,Instrumental
Eternity,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Something about you really moves me
You found the waterfalls, the treasures in me
What is the gift that you possess?
What is this strange happiness?
I will find the answer
And if the answer is you
My love
I'll have to have you
For eternity
I'll have to have you

Something in your voice
Something in your eyes
I don't feel so lost
And I don't have to hide
Something has set me free
And I don't mind
That I can't explain
I just choose to believe
That you have something to do with it

And I'll find the answer
And if the answer is you
My love
I'll have to have you
For eternity
I'll have to have you
I'll have to have you
For eternity
I'll have to have you"
I'm Just a Lucky So and So,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"As I walk down the street
Seems everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

The birds in every tree
Are all so neighborly
They sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

If you should ask me the amount
In my bank account
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
But that don't worry me, confidentially
I've got a dream that's a pippin'

And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so"
There Is No Greater Love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than that you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you"
When I'm Called Home,Abbey Lincoln,Jazz,"When I'm called home
I will bring a book
That tells of strange and funny turns
And of the heart it took
To keep on living in a world
That never was my own
A world of haunted memories
Of other worlds unknown.
I'll tell them of the trouble here
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will sing a song
And tell them of a beggar's life
Where everything goes wrong
Where everybody's hopes and dreams
Are shattering by the wind.

I'll tell them of a ghostly world
Of us and they and him.
I'll tell them how the shadows fall
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will tell the stars
Of the battles that were lost
In a world of wars.
I will tell the rivers
Of the children lost at sea
Of a how a soul is bartered
And what it costs a spirit free.
Hallelujah tell a story, oh,
When they call me home."
Beat Me Daddy_ Eight To The Bar,The Andrews Sisters,Jazz,"Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
He can play piano any way that you like it 
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar 
When he plays, it's a ball 
He's the daddy of them all 

The people gather around when he gets on the stand 
Then when he plays, he gets a hand 
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there bothers to dance 
But when he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank 
A-plunkin' on the keys 
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff 
A-riffin' out with ease 
And when he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar 
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano 
And we all know 
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance 
The cats all holler ""Hooray"" 
You'll hear them say, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
When he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler, ""Beat me up Daddy, beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

The people gather around when he gets up on the stand 
Then when he plays, he gets a hand 
The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there ever bothers to dance 
But when he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

A-plink plink, a-plank plank, a-plink plank, plink plank 
A-plunkin' on the keys 
A-riff riff, a-raff raff, a-riff raff, riff raff 
A-riffin' out with ease

Get Out Of Town,Patricia Barber,Jazz,"Get out of town before it's too late my love
Get out of town be good to me please
Why wish me harm? Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm the birds off the trees?

Just disappear, I care for you much too much
And when you're near close to me dear we touch too much
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That darling it's getting me down, so on your mark get set get out of town

Just disappear, I care for you much too much
And when you're near close to me dear we touch too much
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That darling it's getting me down, so on your mark get set get out of town"
Hello Dolly,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Hello Dolly!
This is Louis, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favorite songs from way back when

So take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Hello, Dolly!
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when

So golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Fellas, she'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again"
Truth & Lies,Us3,Jazz,"A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
But I can't find the words that properly describes
The problems that arise

So I gotta decide to either
Keep it bottled inside or swallow my pride
But I got God on my side I'm a follow his guide
So I got down on my knees, apologized

For all the times my son looked in his fathers eyes
And saw the lies and alibis
Next day to my surprise when I woke at sunrise
I saw my son rise right next to me

Put his hands on my head and said to me
In a voice best described as heavenly
The truth shall set you free
Stop letting me walk around with blindness on

I'm relying on you to teach me right from wrong
'Cause one day I'll be gone, won't be a child for long
You've found your words, now go write your song

Who, what, when, where, why?
How do I find which way to reply?
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
Surprise, the truth's right in front of your eyes

Riddle me this
You see a man slitting his wrists
And he's rich
Beautiful women wanna give him a kiss

He was given a gift but it wasn't something he wished
He'd rather throw it all away for some ignorant bliss
To exist or not to exist? That's a question I try to resist
Deep like a bottomless pit

So I swallow my pride and follow my wits
My motto is this, hold your head high
You could call it a risk
But if I can't live on my feet I'll die on my knees

Sowing the seeds of the struggle
I gotta be free or better yet I gotta be me
I gotta believe that if the truth is a lie
Then knowledge is key

So yo, gimme the question and let me dissect it
My questions are deeper than my jealousy's best diss
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind
I gotta find what I seek or I'll never respond

Who, what, when, where, why?
How do I find which way to reply?
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
Surprise, the truth's right in front of your eyes

We've been lied to, we got reparations due
While you're at it, where's our 40 acres too?
Save the mule? In fact you can save the bull
Why should we believe anything you say is true?

Been waiting too long man, them days are through
We no longer cater to red, white and blue
I posed those same questions to you-know-who
He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you""

I said well when exactly you gonna do for us too
And where will we be when it finally comes through
Forget it, I don't know why I'm asking you
You stole our ballots too we know how you do

The proud and few, we never ever doubted you
Until we found out how your accountants
Grew fat from laying us flat, taking the rap obeying your crap
Seeing the real reason that we're breaking our backs

And yo, we wanna know why the leaders are gone
People can die, corporations treat us as pawns
You can see that it's wrong but you let them lead us along
They're the same corporations that you need to be strong

And I know that it's a game, truth is I shoulder the blame
I'm just another con artist making a claim
I know I need more than my words working for change
It makes me frustrated that I'm seeking personal gain but tell me

Who, what, when, where, why?
How do I find which way to reply?
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
Surprise, the truth's right in front of your eyes"
My Baby Just Cares For Me,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for furs and laces
My baby don't care for high toned places

My baby don't care for rings
Or other expensive things
She is sensible as can be

My baby don't care, who knows it
My baby just cares for me

My baby's no Brando fan
Rock Hudson is not her man
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for Tyrone Power
She'd rather be with me by the hour

Jeff Chandler is not her style
And Liberace smile
Is something she just can't see

I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
She answers my prayers for
My baby just cares for little old me

At least that's what she tells me anyway"
A Lover Is Blue,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"Yesterday we were gay,
I was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow,
You've gone, and so a lover is blue
Life was sweet, so complete,
Now I've suddenly waken to find I'm forsaken,
Alone, and so a lover is blue
Do you still remember our love affair,
Does it matter to you,
But I'll have to go through our door to care
Here and there everywhere,
Every scene just reminds me
Of something that binds me
To you, and so a lover is blue"
Lost Without U,Marcus Miller,Jazz,"I'm lost without u

The Shadow Of Your Smile,Astrud Gilberto,Jazz,"The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love, and see
All the lovely things
You are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now, when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile"

Sometimes I'm Happy,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue

Depends on you

I never mind
The rain from the skies
If I can find
The sun in your eyes
