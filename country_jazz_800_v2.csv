It Makes No Difference Now,Billie Jo Spears,Country,"Makes no difference now what kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along without you now that's plain to see
I don't care what happens next 'cause I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

It was just a year ago when I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
I know that something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

After all is said and done I'll soon forget you
Although I know that it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now"
Trashcan tomcat,Jim Lauderdale,Country,"Call me trashcan tomcat*
I'm as lonesome as a song
Call me trashcan tomcat
And you will never call me wrong
Meet me in the silver starlight
When the dusty day is through
Wiggle through the door to midnight
I'll be waiting there for you
Baby set aside some downtime
Well baby take off your chain
Baby if you got the incline
I can ease you of your pain
Even madness has its season
Well you know it's difficult
Never ask to know the reason
When you can judge by the result
Call me trashcan tomcat
I'm as lonesome as a song
Call me trashcan tomcat
And you will never call me wrong
Here among the bones and fish tails
Beneath the Mississippi moon
I'll speak of love that never fails
I will even sing the tune
Call me trashcan tomcat
I'm as lonesome as a song
Call me trashcan tomcat
Lonely as the day is long
I will leave you in the morning
When my alley run is through
Disappear without a warning
But I will never leave you blue
I will search among the tatters
And the scaps of people's dreams
Sift the ash for all that matters
Try to tell you what it means
Call me trashcan tomcat
I'm as lonesome as a song
Call me trashcan tomcat
Lonely as the day is long
Just call me trashcan tomcat
Lonely as the day is long"
My Love (Album Version),LITTLE TEXAS,Country,"Get on your mark, get set
Ready or not here I come
You've been looking for love
Well honey, I can give you some
When your world is standing still
I can turn it around
Put your head up in the clouds
And pick your feet off the ground

My love
Are you ready for my love, my love
My love, my love is ready for you.
If you're looking for a heart that's always true
Only to you, then my love
My love, my love is ready for you.

Girl, I've heard it said
That love is good for the soul
I see the hunger in your eyes
Burning out of control
My love is overflowing from a loving cup
Girl, I know you're down
But love will lift you up.

Girl, I know your're down
But love will lift you up

My love, my love is ready for you... (x2)"
Indian Love Call,Slim Whitman,Country,"When I'm calling you
Will you answer too?

That means I offer my love to you to be your own
If you refuse me I will be blue, waiting all alone

But if when you hear my love call ringing clear
And I hear your answering echo so dear
Then I will know our love will come true
You'll belong to me, I'll belong to you

Then I will know our love will come true
You'll belong to me, I'll belong to you"
Letter To Heaven,Dolly Parton,Country,"An old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away 
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee 
Saying won't you please write a letter for me 
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go 
She's happy up there with her mommy I know"
I Got Him Ready For You,Chely Wright,Country,"I taught him how to talk to me
I showed him what a woman needs
A hand just to hold in the dark
He used to think it was enough
Sending flowers to show love
Now he knows he's gotta open his heart
And the saddest thing 'bout how it all came down
Is he's not here with me now

I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you

I wouldn't say I have regrets
'Bout the time that we both spent
If the truth be known, I'm a little better too
So when he does the little things, when he treats you like a queen
In a crazy way I'm bearing the rood
Ooh, I feel like I did all the fixing in mud
But you moved into our house of love

I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you

I don't blame you, I'm not saying you stole him away from me
I just want you to know he's not the man he used to be, yeah

He's come a long long way
And it's tragic but true
I guess I've got him ready for you
I guess I've got him ready for you"
Moonshiner's Daughter,Hayseed Dixie,Country,"It was a lovely day for a wedding
And the folks were all dressed in black
When she said ""I do,"" I said ""me too""
With a shotgun pointed at my back

I married a moonshiner's daughter
How could I go wrong?
'Cause the moonshiner's daughter cooks up corn and water
And makes me liquor all night long

Well, the preacher was as drunk as he could get, lord
And her brothers and her dad were too, of course
Her mom whispered in my ear, ""if she don't satisfy you, dear
Just come on down and get you some at the source.""

I married a moonshiner's daughter
How could I go wrong?
'Cause the moonshiner's daughter cooks up corn and water

Got a room down on Dickerson Pike
When the desk clerk, he asked me, ""how old is she?""
I said, ""old enough to know just what I like""

How could I go wrong?
'Cause the moonshiner's daughter cooks up corn and water
And makes me liquor all night long"
Fire And Smoke,Earl Thomas Conley,Country,"In and out of honkey tonks from one town to the next.
But anything worth loving
Lord's, just too hard to forget.
Everyday's another day of feeling more the same.
Looks like I'll run out of highway before
I out run the rain.

But if there's fire and smoke,
Ooh what a rush I got when your love was hot.
Oh but I couldn't see.
That when the flame burned out you'd leave
A cold dark cloud a raining down on me.

So I'm reaching out to someone wishing, she were you instead.
Everything I left behind was waiting up ahead.
Pulling on the bottom baby, looking back on you.
Anyways the right way babe as long as I pull through.

But if there's fire and smoke,
Ooh what a rush I got when your love was hot.

A cold dark cloud a raining down on me.

Yeah, and when the flame burned out you left a cold dark cloud a raining
Down, a raining down on me."
Jackson,Johnny Cash,Country,"We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout

...Ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around

Filipino Baby,Hank Locklin,Country,"When the warship left Manila sailing proudly o'er the sea
Many sailors hearts were filled with sad regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty gal they've met
Well up stopped a little sailor with his bright eyes all aglow
Saying take a look my gal's photograph
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my treasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
And I love my little Filipino baby

In a little rustic cottage in the Port of Fillippines
Dwells a pretty little maiden all alone
And she's thinking of her true love though he's far off cross the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby..."

Have you been hurt by some girl 
Who came to take you for a ride 
It seems when you woke up one mornin'

Calypso,John Denver,Country,"To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and the living
In search of the answers to questions unknown
To be part of the movement, part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand

Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well

Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well

Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit

Highway Robbery,Tanya Tucker,Country,"Ok Officer, I Admit it,
I was speedin'
But before you write me up
Let me tell you the reason.
I wasn't tryin' to out run you,
I was chasin' a guy who outta
The blue, he committed a crime
Back about a mile or two.

Smiled like we were meant to be.

Moving car.

Grabbed my heart and took
Off on the run.

Everywhere I look I see a lot
Of the same ole same thing

I thank God each day that
I get to hold an original.

Your touch, your kiss,

You're like nothin' else.

The way you think
The way you love me crazy.
The way you get to me
Like no one has before.

When you look at me that way.
When I think I've seen it all
You show me more.
When you get this close
It's easy to know the difference.

The more I can tell.

Just Another Heartache,Chely Wright,Country,"(Ed Hill/Mark D. Sanders)

I'm fallin' head over heals for him

When I talk he likes to listen
He says I'm the one that he's been missin'
Somebody tell me that he isn't.

Another bad lie another goodbye
Lookin' for another heart to break.

Maybe I'm too cautious for my own good
Maybe he's the real deal knock on wood

I'll be over my limit with.

Blue Bedroom,Toby Keith,Country,"Woke up this morning with day old coffee
Smoked what was left of your cigarette
Sit by the phone just in case you call me
It ain't ringing yet
You're probably half way to Albuquerque
You'll hang a north up to Santa Fe
You'll never know just how much it hurt me
To watch you walk away

From my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

You never told me why you were leaving
I guess you did what you had to do
If you find that love is what you're needing
It's waiting here for you

From my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

You left a red dress, some purple shoes
That silver comb that you never used
A yellow ribbon from your hair
Baby you're still everywhere

In my blue bedroom

Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you
I'm needing you
Baby I want you
In my blue bedroom"
It's Been So Long,Webb Pierce,Country,"It's been so long since we said goodbye
I guess that's the reason why I sit and cry
I miss you baby every day and night
It's been so long since I held you tight

Everything's different since you went away
It gets so lonely every night and day
I can't help feeling that you ought to know
I love you baby and I miss you so

Nothing ever seems the same
My sunshine has turned to rain
Every time I hear your name
My heart becomes a burning flame

Darby's Castle,Kris Kristofferson,Country,"See the ruin on the hill
Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground."
Unlove Me,Julie Roberts,Country,"Unloose this hold you've got on me
Unlock this heart that can't get free
Unlive the night you kissed and hugged me
Undream the dreams that we both shared
Unfeel the feelin' that you cared
Before you leave me, please unlove me.

Unlove me
Unmake all the memories I can't forget
Unlove me
Let me go back to the way I was before we met

Back to the days when I was strong
When t wasn't sad to be alone
When I was happy-go-lucky.
And I didn't know how good it felt 
To hold you and feel my heart melt
Show a little mercy and unlove me

Unlove me
Untie all the strings between your heart and mine
Unlove me
But do it real slow, so I don't have to lose you all at one time

Before you pack your bags and leave
One thing I wish you'd do for me 
Take a little time to just unlove me

Unlove me
Unmake all the memories I can't forget
Unlove me
Let me go back to the way I was before we met

Unloose this hold you've got on me
Unlock this heart that can't get free
Before you leave me, please unlove me
Show a little mercy and unlove me."
It's All Coming Back To Me Now,Keith Whitley,Country,"That innocent look in her green eyes
Sparkle when she starts to laugh
Memories of her start to fill up my mind
Like pieces of torn photographs

It's all come'n back to me now
I thought I'd forget her somehow
But my mind can't forget what
My heart won't allow
It's all come'n back to me now

That desparate look in her green eyes
When she said good bye in the rain
It tears me to pieces
I have to recall
How I caused her all of that pain

And it's all come'n back to me now
I thought I'd forget her somehow
But my mind can't forget what
My heart won't allow
It's all come'n back to me now"
Barbie Doll,Jack Ingram,Country,"I see you looking and I know what you think
You're getting braver with every drink but

Talking to him but she ain't hearing a thing
If you were smart you'd turn around and let her go

That girls' a Barbie doll
A Barbie doll
She's real good-looking but she's got no heart at all

She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her
Boyfriend's old man's brand-new car
She's got no idea what she does or why

She does whatever she wants I guess
Whatever comes first or whatever looks best
Nobody I know has ever seen her cry

That girls' a Barbie doll
A Barbie doll
She's real good-looking but she's got no heart at all

You should have seen her last Saturday night

Nobody I know swears she's even real

On The Other Hand (Remastered Album Version),Randy Travis,Country,"On one hand I count the reasons, I could stay with you
And hold you close to me, all night long
So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you
On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

Yeah the reason I must go, is on the other hand"
The Little Lady Preacher,Tom T. Hall,Country,"Oh, the little lady preacher from the limestone church
I'll never forget her, I guess
She preached each Sunday mornin' on the local radio
With a big black Bible and a snow-white dress

She was 19 years of age and was developed to a fault
But I will admit she knew the Bible well
A little white lace hanky marked the text that she would use
She'd breathe into that microphone and send us all to hell

She had a guitar picker by the name of luther short
A hairy-legged soul lost out in sin
She would turn and smile at luther when the program would commence
With a voice as sweet as angels she would break out in a hymn

I was pickin' for her too with what we call the doghouse bass
I clung to every word that passed her lips
She was down on booze and cigarettes and high on days to come
And she'd punctuate the prophecy with movements of her hips


The lord knows how I loved her, he was there each time she preached
But ol' luther took her home each Sunday morn'
Lookin' back I still recall the way it hurt my tender pride
I longed to be a hero but they're made not born

Sometimes ol' luther showed up at the studio half-tight
And smokin' was a thing he liked to do
She never said a word to him but said a prayer for me
I told her in a way that I'd been prayin' for her too

One Sunday her old man showed up and said that she was gone
Said she and brother luther had a call
I can see me standin' in that studio that day
I had to face the heartbreak, unemployment and all

I don't know where they are 'cause I ain't seen them people since
Lord if I judge 'em let me give 'em lots o' room
I know ol' luther short and he's a hard ol' boy to change
And I've often sat and wondered who it was converted whom"
Two Different Roads,Michael Nesmith,Country,"You can't try to walk down two different roads
Look to both of them to bring you home
You must take your own way, though it is the long way
And sometimes you find yourself alone
I know, this all happened once before

Sometimes you think, ""I'll wait,""
But he who hesitates is lost
This is not just a game
It's the problem of creation, and only meditation
Can make your mind and age the same
I know, for this all happened once before

You better move along, don't wait and let the dawn
And its friendly sunrise catch you at rest
Do what you must, no man can criticize you
As long as what you're doing is your best
I know, for this all happened once before
I know, for this all happened once before"
Play Me Some Fiddle,The Charlie Daniels Band,Country,"Every time I hear a fiddle and it's cookin' just a little
Well, it makes me want to jump up and run
And if he's sawing with some soul boogie woogie rock 'n' roll
Well, I know I'm gonna have some fun

And when the rosin' starts to fly and I'm lookin' in the eye
Like I'm just about to blow a fuse
Mama, call the doctor 'cause your boy has got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues

I met a man from Tennessee, this is what he said to me
He said, ""Music is a rhapsody""
He picked up his violin, stuck it underneath his chin
And started playing me a symphony

I said, ""That ain't the way it's done, let me see that fiddle son
And I sawed him off a chorus or two""
He said, ""You'd better call the doctor 'cause I think I've got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues""

Now if you want to play me some fiddle
I'll tell you right from the start
You'd better play me something lowdown hoedown honking
I don't want to hear no funeral march

It's got to pick me up and roll me over
It's got to make me want to jump up and sing
If it ain't buzzing like a beehive, kick it into overdrive
Or it don't mean a doggone thing

So let me rosin' up my bow and I think that I can show you
The way I like to play this thing
Let's put some boogie rhythm in it, kick it on up to the limit
I'm gonna put some fire on these strings

And if you feel your feet start moving to the beat
And you feel like you've got ants in your shoes
Well you'd better call the doctor 'cause you've probably got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues"
Every Time She Passes By,George Ducas,Country,"She comes strolling down the street
(Every time she passes by)
My head spins when our eyes meet
(Every time she passes by)
Her perfume fills my head
(Every time she passes by)
I hang on every word she says
(Every time she passes by)

This ain't infatuation
Mere idle fascination
My love gets stronger every time
Every time she passes by

I get tongue tied and words don't come
(Every time she passes by)
I'm working all my courage up
(Every time she passes by)
I wanna ask her on the town
(Every time she passes by)
Here's my chance she's coming round
Here's my chance to make her mine

This ain't infatuation
Mere idle fascination
My love gets stronger every time
Every time she passes

Look at how she smiles at me
Before to long I know she'll be the answer to my every dream come true

Now look at us we're hand in hand
(Every time she passes by)
I know I'm a lucky man
(Every time she passes by)

This ain't infatuation
Mere idle fascination
My love gets stronger every time
Every time she passes by

Every time she passes by
Every time she passes by"
That Rock Won't Roll,Restless Heart,Country,"Every little move she makes,
Is gonna catch somebody's eye.
You ought to see all the double-takes,
When she goes walkin' by.
But she's so distant.
She seems so cold.

Everybody says that rock won't roll.
They say the girl's got a heart of stone.
That rock won't roll,
Oh, but she's too pretty to be alone.
I've got all this love inside me,
And I've just got to see,
If that rock won't roll.

I'll give her everything I've got,
I'm gonna change her point of view.
I'll keep tryin' and I won't stop,
Until the love in her eyes shines through.
When I show her,
This heart of gold.

Then we'll see if that rock won't roll,
They say the girl's got a heart of stone.
That rock won't roll,
Oh, but she's too pretty to be alone.
I've got all this love inside me,
And I've just got to see,
If that rock won't roll.

I've got all this love inside me,
And I've just got to see,
If that rock won't roll.

Oh, she's so pretty,
But that rock won't roll.
Ooh, and I've just got to see,

To Fade.

If that rock won't roll.
That rock won't roll.
I just can't believe that rock won't roll."
Six Days On The Road,Dave Dudley,Country,"Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh, a-rollin' down that Eastern Seaboard
I got my diesel wound up and she's a-runnin' like a-never before
There's a speed zone ahead, but all right 
I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

I got me ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm taking little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in a white 
I been a passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lot of women but I'm not a-like a-some other guys
I could find one to hold me tight 
But I could never make believe it's all right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

ICC is a checking on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight 
I can dodge all the scales all right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and that smoke's a-blowing black as coal
My hometown's a-comin' in sight 
If you think I'm a-happy, you're right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight"
American Soldier,Toby Keith,Country,"I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at 'em bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for money
There's bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory
I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure
Being all that I can be

And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekend's been too strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long
You can bet that I stand ready
When the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady
Hey I'm true down to the core

And I will always do my duty
No matter what the price
I've counted up the cost
I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dyin's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
'Cause freedom don't come free

I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters
I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy
I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
Sleep in peace tonight
American soldier
I'm an American soldier

Beside my brothers and my sisters
I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy
I will always do what's right

Let Me Go Home Whiskey,Asleep At The Wheel,Country,"Henry

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home juiced no more
I stop by a fence to visit with a friend of mine
I just dropped in for a minute
But I over stayed my time

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders
Don't you come home drunk no more

Why oh why does whiskey
Make me lose my head
Got me sitting at a bar
When I should be home in bed

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door

Not to come home drunk no more

Whiskey every night
As long as I got my whiskey

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Don't you come home drunk no more"
Maybe It Was Memphis,Pam Tillis,Country,"Looking at you through a misty moonlight,
Katydid sing like a symphony.
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby,
Melody blowing through the willow tree.

What was I s'posed to do,
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home...

Maybe it was Memphis,
Maybe it was southern summer nights.
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me,
But it sure felt right.

Read about you in a Faulkner novel,
Met you once in a Williams' play.
Heard about you in a country love song,
Summer night beauty took my breath away.

What was I s'posed to do,
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home.

Maybe it was Memphis,
Maybe it was southern summer nights.
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me,
But it sure felt right.

Maybe it was Memphis,
Maybe it was southern summer nights.
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me,
But it sure felt right.

Every night now since I been back home,
I lie awake drifting in my memory.
Think about you on your mama's front porch swing
Talking that way, so soft to me.

What was I s'posed to do,
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home

Maybe it was Memphis,
Maybe it was southern summer nights.
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me,
But it sure felt right."
Too Busy Being In Love,Doug Stone,Country,"If I had taken the time
To write down a few lines
Everytime that you crossed this heart of mine
I'd put them all in a book
How much time would that have took
The words and years have a way of slipping back

Oh no! Too bad, there goes the chance that I had
I could have written a play so sweet and so funny
Given old Mr. Shakespere a run for his money
Written the words to the prettiest tune
That would never leave a dry eye in the room
My only excuse for not doing enough
I was too busy being in love
Yes I was too busy being in love

Brand new phrases appear every time you are near
All this words you inspire after all these years
But I never reached for a pen
Break the mood that I'm in
Before I knew that the words were gone again

Oh no! Too bad, there goes the chance that I had
I could have written a play so sweet and so funny
Given old Mr. Shakespere a run for his money
Written the words to the prettiest tune
That would never leave a dry eye in the room
My only excuse for not doing enough
I was too busy being in love
Yes I was too busy being in love

I could have written the poem to make young lovers crazy
I could have written the movie for Hepburn and Tracey
Most beautiful song and it starts with your name
Written my way into fortune and fame
But I have no regrets for not doing enough
I was too busy being in love
Yes I was too busy being in love"
Bubbles in My Beer,Bob Wills,Country,"Awww nana, yes
Watchin' the bubbles in my beer
Come in Tommy, give us the lowdown on it

Tonight in a bar, alone I'm sitting (yes?)
Apart from the laughter and the cheer (that's not good)
While scenes from the past rise before me (yeah)
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye (aww)
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer (yeah)

Well, alright
Oh oh
Hot Thomas

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled (yeah)
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

As I think of the heart that I've broken
And of the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty (aww now)
As empty as the bubbles in my beer"
Why Don't You Spend The Night,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"How did it get so late, where did the night go to
Strange how it slips away when I'm with you
I know it's almost two, I know you should leave, but wait
I've thought it over and there's something I gotta say.

Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right
Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light
It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone
Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?

Maybe I spoke too soon and maybe my timing's wrong
Or maybe it's something I shouldn't have said at all
But when I look in your eyes, I feel like we're almost one
Ah, something tells me the night's only just begun.

Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right
Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light
It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone
Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?

Wild As A Turkey,Hayes Carll,Country,"Well I'm wild as a turkey, higher than a Christmas moon
Empty as my wallet on a Sunday afternoon
I come around too fast, and I always leave too soon
Ain't that what they all say?

I come down from Memphis, with a broken down Corvette
A suitcase full of memories, and face you won't forget
You say you'll never love me, but the night ain't over yet
I'm gonna change your mind

Girl I've been a gambler since the age of 21
I've seen my share of troubles and the wrong end of a gun
This whole worlds out to get me just because I have my fun
They ain't gonna slow me anyway

Right ain't right babe, and left ain't always wrong
I bet you're tired of dancing to the same old song
You look like an angel in a place you don't belong
I'm gonna take you away

Just because this place is closing that don't mean it's time for bed
We don't need no sleep girl, we'll get plenty when we're dead
Oh these fools behind you and come with me instead
I'm gonna show you a time

Well I'm wild as a turkey
Higher than a Christmas moon
Empty as my wallet on a Sunday afternoon
I come around too fast, and I always leave too soon
Ain't that what they all say?"
Let The Chips Fall,Charley Pride,Country,"I'm finding that I'm spending most of my time
Wondering where she goes the rest of the time
But tonight I will find out for once and for all
Tonight I will follow her and let the chips fall
So let the chips fall let them fall where they may
My moment of truth is fast on its way
Soon I will know for once and for all so I'll just cross my fingers and let the chips fall

The life that I'm living is just half a life the girl that I married is just half a wife
But my life without her would be no life at all
Still I must know the truth so let the chips fall
Let the chips fall let them fall where they may
I'm ashamed of the game but there's no other way
I must hold her hand a man cannot crawl
So put the cards on the table and let the chips fall"
Wish I Still Had You,Alison Krauss,Country,"Walking out on me must be the way
You show me how it feels to be her
I realize the fault is mine
I'm getting everything that I deserve

It's over and older, the tears seem much colder
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
It's over and older, the tears seem much colder
Each passing day I wish I still had you

My troubles would be all over now
If I could only get you off my mind
And I would give a fortune now
If I could only hold you one more time

It's over and older, the tears seem much colder
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
It's over and older, the tears seem much colder
Each passing day I wish I still had you

Dream Me Home,Mac Davis,Country,"Well, it's two a.m. in Nashville
Midnight in L.A.
You're asleep and
I'm out on the road

And I know that you can't hear me
But I'm talking anyway
It helps me kill some time
Ease the load

Hon, the man didn't like my song
And he sent me on my way
And I put my bus fare
On that tootie's bar

I'm out on Murfreesboro Road
Hitchhiking to L.A.
And the rain's pouring down
On my guitar

Honey, dream, dream me home
Dream me safely to your door
Won't you dream, dream me home
And I swear that I won't
Leave you no more

Well, no one wants to help out
The longhair hippie freak
At two a.m. in Nashville, Tennessee

They threw me out of the truck stop
And I got no place to sleep
If this freedom, Lord
It ain't for me

Hon, I'm hanging up
My Nashville dream
As soon as I get home
And I'll share my songs
With no one else but you

We'll sing 'em up together
They'll be mine and yours alone
I'll be all the things
You wanted me to

If you'll just
Dream, dream me home
Dream me safely to your door
Honey, dream, dream me home
And I swear that I won't
Leave you no more

Baby, dream, dream me home
Dream, dream me home
I wish you would
Dream, dream me home

Come on, baby
Dream, dream me home

I'll Come Running,Connie Smith,Country,"If you ever want somebody to love if you ever get to feeling blue
If you ever want a little company then I'll come running to you
It's been so long since I held you tight but I still dream about you darling every night
I don't care who was wrong or who was right I'll come running to you
Now all my love belongs to you that's just the way that I feel
And if you'd give me the least little chance I'd show you my love is really real
Well I'm not a bit ashamed to sit here and wait if that's all what I've got to do
Yeah I'll be around if your new love turns you down and I'll come running to you"
I Can Let Go Now,Collin Raye,Country,"(Michael McDonald)

It was so right
It was so wrong
Almost at the same time
The pain and ache
A heart can take 
No one really knows
When the memories cling
And keep you there
'Til you no longer care
And you can let go now

It's wrong for me
To cling to you


Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be
It's not like me
To hold somebody down
But I was tossed high by love
Almost never came down
Only to land here
But love's no longer found
Where I'm no longer bound
And I can let go now

I can let go now"

Old Memory,Ashton Shepherd,Country,"I've got a pocket full of money I shouldn't spend
To drink him away again
My heart stops cold in my chest
There he is in the back of the bar, looking his best

He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

No, he's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me"
If You Were Losing Him To Me,Jean Shepard,Country,"You say I'm bein' selfish 'cause I won't set him free
But once I've given him to you what is left for me
You say that he don't love me but now that may be true
But if you were losing him to me I wonder what you'd do
If you were losing everything that made your world go round
Would you hang on till he'd forgot the other love he'd found
Or would you really let him go the way you want me to
If you were losing him to me I wonder what you'd do

You've had your stolen moments but how can they compare
With the many ups and downs that we have had to share
I want him to be happy even if it means with you
But if you were losing him to me I wonder what you'd do
If you were losing everything..."
Not Tonight,The Infamous Stringdusters,Country,"Oh I'll be home again

Would you let me in
If not tonight

Oh not tonight
Not tonight
Oh not tonight"
If We Loved,Chuck Wicks,Country,"The prisons are empty
The homeless have houses

Nobody's poor
Nobody's judged by their faith or their color
Nobody's wrong in this world without war
We buried our swords
We don't fight anymore

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yeah, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder

Nobody's lonely, used, or neglected
Children are cherished from the day that they're born
Even a stranger's never a stranger
No bars on the windows
No locks on our doors
'Cause we open our doors
Not afraid anymore

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yeah, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder

Just think of how much better off we'd be
If we open up our hearts
If we believe

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yeah, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Oh
If we loved

Walkin' In,Tracy Byrd,Country,"I've done my share of walkin' out

Why Would I Say Goodbye,Brooks & Dunn,Country,"I guess I lost my head last night
Kept on till I made you cry
Walked out with my stubborn pride
Wasn't nothing you could do to stop me
I hit the road but I didn't get far
Just drove around all night in my car
Now I'm not sure where to start
To tell you that I'm sorry

I just want to hold you
I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to leave
I just want to be with you
And after living alone, lost for so long
Finally found the love of my life
Why would I say goodbye

I don't know what is is about the edge of a cliff
Makes we want to get so close to it
I guess this time I finally slipped
What a foolish way to end it
Maybe that's why I'm back here now
Got both feet back on the ground

Hopin' you won't turn me down
When I ask you for forgiveness

I just want to hold you
I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to leave
I just want to be with you
And after living alone, lost for so long
Finally found the love of my life
Why would I say goodbye"
I Go Back,Kenny Chesney,Country,"'Jack and Diane' painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back
(I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back
I go back"
Make Up Your Mind,Deana Carter,Country,"I don't understand the things you do
The more you think the more I think you are confused
It shouldn't be so hard to figure out
What you can and can not live without so why can't you

CHORUS make up your mind
I'm going crazy
After all this time you'd think that maybe
You would realize
That no one could love you like I do
And I just can'tkeep waiting here for you
To make up your mind

I don't know what it is that your searching for
I wonder if you wonder if there's someting more out there
And even though it'll break my heart
I can't keep going on and on the way things are, it's not fair

I don't wanna have to tell you goodbye
But baby trust me I will
And I might regret it for the rest of my life
But I can't change the way I feel
Don't you realize that no one else could love you
Like I do but I just can't keep waiting here for you
To make up your mind
I don't understand the things you do
The more you think the more I think you are confused
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Make up your mind"
Got The Bull By The Horns,Johnny Horton,Country,"I love the brunettes, the red heads and blonde haired gals
Yeah, I done it since I don't know when
Use to go down the line and love 'em all
Then I'd start all over again, I'd start all over again

I've got the bull by the horns on a downhill drag
Things are better than they ever have been
Yeah, I missed a lotta lovin' in my lifetime
But I'm never gonna do it again, I'm never gonna do it again

As a boy in school I guess I done pretty well
All the girls hung around me then
But I'd get shy and I'd let 'em get away
But I'm never gonna do it again, I'm never gonna do it again

I've got the bull by the horns on a downhill drag
Things are better than they ever have been
Yeah, I missed a lotta lovin' in my lifetime
But I'm never gonna do it again, I'm never gonna do it again

I've been a-rompin' and a-stompin' all over this town
Tryin' to find the places you've been
'Cause I missed your huggin' at last around
So let's go 'round again, yeah let's go 'round again

I've got the bull by the horns on a downhill drag
Things are better than they ever have been
'Cause I missed a lotta lovin' in my lifetime
But I'm never gonna do it again, I'm never gonna do it again"
If I Talk To Him,Connie Smith,Country,"If I talk to him I take him back again so if he calls please tell him I'm not home
He's gone again I told him we were through
That he could live his life the way he wanted to
I said my love for him had died but I know it's not true
And if I talk to him my feelings would show through
Yes if I talk to him I take him back again I'm afraid to even answer the phone
'Cause if I talk to him I take him back again
So if he calls please tell him I'm not home

I tell my heart I'm better off without him now
But like the other times he change my mind somehow
He'd shed some tears and talk sweet talk I'm sure that I believe
But this time it's the end if he'll just let me be
But if I talk to him I take him back again..."
Loose Talk,Carl Smith,Country,"So long we've been married last burdens we've carried
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we made up someone seems to break up
Oh darling what else can we do
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

They say you are leaving that you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see
We may have to leave here..."
I Cried All The Way To The Altar,Patsy Cline,Country,"I cried all the way to the altar
A smile was on my face
But tears were in my heart

Two hearts broken
And a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Oh my darlin', now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I see the damage I have done

Oh, my darling, now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part"
Let Your Love Flow,Bellamy Brothers,Country,"There's a reason for the sunshine sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love light shines
All around us

So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the moonlit nights
With your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love rites shine
All around us

So let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean

Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow..."
Don't Give Up On Me,Jason Aldean,Country,"I don't go to church enough,
I curse out loud I drink too much,
I'm more of a sinner than a saint,
Gotta dusty bible on my shelf,
I just pick it up when I need help,
Lord knows there's a lot I need to change,
And I want to baby you make me want to,

You tie the knot when I'm at the end of my rope,
You never stop believing in me when I don't know,
Who I am or what I'm supposed to be,
I don't give you no good reasons,
But baby don't give up on me,

I've smoked my last cigarette,
At least a hundred times I bet,
I guess I'll just keep quitting till it sticks,
But for all the things I've failed to do,
I've never failed at loving you,
We both know I can't grant your every wish,
But I want to baby you make me want to,"
That's A Woman,Mark Wills,Country,"Chestnut hair with just a touch of gray
Shadows of a few more years on her face
That ain't the girl that I knew yesterday
Oh no, now, that's a woman.

Up and running at the crack of dawn
There ain't always time to get her make up on
But she's more beautiful without it on
Oh yeah, that's a woman.

She's got a grace that I don't understand
She can move mountains with those tender hands
She makes a king out of a common man
Yeah, that's me, lucky me.

--- Instrumental ---
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

She makes a king out of a common man
Yeah, that's me.
Yeah, that's me.

In the evening when the kids are down
And I can see she's getting sleepy now
Still she finds some time for me somehow
Oh, now, that's a woman..."
She's Taken A Shine,John Berry,Country,"Rosie never was one for turnin' heads
She was just always kinda there
She had a few nice features more or less
No red ribbons in her hair
Since that Jesse's been comin' to the diner
Folks are sayin' that she's never looked finer
She's got a different air

She's taken a shine to him
Becomin the woman that she's never been
And all of the guys are wishin they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now there's a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem, the diamond within
She's taken a shine

Rosie hardly ever missed a bit of work
Never took vacation days
Home or the diner it was all the same to her
She didn't know any other way
But each afternoon now she starts to come alive
Cause Jesse's there each day to pick her up at five
You oughta hear them say

Oh what a little love can do
Now that she's found herself
She's stronger than she ever knew

She's taken a shiiiiiiiiiine
She's taken a shiiiiiiiiiine"
Jezebel,Chely Wright,Country,"I give him love the best I can
But you don't seem to understand
It's not always deep but it's always true
And he does not belong to you
Hey

I do not forgive and I do not forget
I will fight for love
Until the death

Jezebel save your charms
He'll be back here in my arms
Oh, how quickly you forget
He's not yours yet
He is not yours, not yet

Gonna throw on this cotton dress
Put lilac scent on the back of my neck
I walk barefoot down that mountainside
Straight to your door
Girl, you can't hide
'Cause

Standing out in the pouring rain
Calling out my lover's name
I know he won't leave me in the cold
Send my baby home
Send my baby home

Jezebel save your charms
He'll be back here in my arms
Oh, how quickly you forget
He's not yours yet (not yours yet)
He's not yours yet (not yours yet)
Oh, he is not yours
Never!"
Delia's Gone,Johnny Cash,Country,"Delia
Oh, Delia
Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor Delia
I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there
Found her in her parlor
And I tied her to her chair
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil
Make me want to grab my submachine
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

First time I shot her
I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

But jailer
Oh, jailer
Jailer, I can't sleep
'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

So if your woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone"
Now I've Seen It All,Travis Tritt,Country,"I watched an acorn
Turn into an Oak tree
I felt the passion
Of a Whippoorwill's call
And I've seen a flower
Bloom in the desert
But a woman so true
Loving me like you do
Now, I've seen it all.

I've seen the faces
They chisled in mountains
Marveled in wonder
At stars when they fall
And I've watched the sun set
Slip into the ocean
But a woman so true
Loving me like you do
Now, I've seen it all.

I feel so unworthy
Of all that you give me
I could die happy
Just knowing I am your man
I'm so undeserving
I just stand here in awe
That a woman so true
Loves me like you do
Girl, I've seen it all.

I feel so unworthy
Of all that you give me, yeah
I could die happy
Just knowing I am your man
'Cause you find perfection
Where others see flaws
When a woman so true
Loving me like you do
Now, I've seen it all, yeah.

A woman so true 
Loving me like you do
Now, I've seen it all..."
There You Go,Johnny Cash,Country,"You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie
Well here I am and there you go, you're gone again
I know you're gonna be the way you've always been
Breakin' hearts and tellin' lies is all you know
Another guy gives you the eye and there you go
There you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

Because I love you so I take much more than I should take
I want you even though I know my heart is gonna break
You build me up and for a while I'm all a-glow
Then your fickle heart sees someone else and there you go
Thre you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie"
New Horizons,Yonder Mountain String Band,Country,"Come son, take hold of my hand now
Come daughter, jump into my arms
Come sweet darling wife, move quickly I'll keep us from harm
Well, the water from the sky, it is coming
And it's rising each minute of the day
And soon our dear home and our pleasures will be washed away

There's a new horizon and it's coming my son
Coming soon but I don't know when
When the sky will dry up and stop all this raging
When we'll be coming back again
The sun is trying to start shining
But the rain is pouring down
With the thunder and the lightning
With the rain is pouring down

For two long weeks it's been falling
And rolling through streets of our town
Forcing families to flee from their homes, pulling crops from the ground
We must leave behind our pleasures
Yes darling we must leave them all behind
Come family now move quickly, higher ground we must find

The sun is trying to start shining
But the rain is pouring down
With the thunder and the lightning
Where the rain is pouring down

As I stand at this lonely hilltop, and I stare at the town down below
Tops of trees and muddy old roofs now all that do show
As the tears roll down my cheeks
And they match with the patter of the rain
Look in the distance for the horizon, pray we'll come again"
Looking Elsewhere,Jim Lauderdale,Country,"Looking elsewhere, looking around
I sat me down, I sat me down
Looking for answers where they can't be found
I come around, I come around

Elsewhere, that's where I was looking
When I should have been looking right over there
Over and over, never too far
That's where I'll be looking, wherever you are

Looking for good love, for love sweet and true
Looking for you, I was looking for you
I knew when I saw you, that my looking was through
Brought you my heart, and I hope it will do

Elsewhere, that's where I was looking
When I should have been looking right over there
Over and over, never too far
That's where I'll be looking, wherever you are

Looking elsewhere from the sky to the ground
From the sea to the sunset, from the hill to the town
From the creek to the bar room, from the dawn till the sun
Sinks over the mountain and another day is done

Elsewhere, that's where I was looking
When I should have been looking right over there
Over and over, right over there
Sweet apple blossoms twined in your hair

Looking elsewhere"
How Bad Do You Want It,Mark Wills,Country,"(Tony Martin/Tom Shapiro/Mark Nesler)

T.J. and Charley had a little bar band
They played covers every Friday night
Bonnie was a waitress and a big fan
And every break the three of them would
Take a drink and talk about life
When it came to love, money or fame
Charley's philosophy was always the same.

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it.

Well, Charley loaded his old Impala
T.J. said, ""I think I'm gonna stay
When you hit it big there, give us a holler.""
And as the dust settled back down
Bonnie turned and asked T.J.
""Why don't you go, you're good enough to try?""
T.J. said, ""Bonnie, Charley was right.""

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
(Do you want it)
It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it, how bad.

Well, Charley got to tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd
And when his silver bus came rollin' through
Well, Bonnie made 'em all a fried chicken dinner
And when she left to get them pie
Charley said, ""I loved her too
How did she end up with you instead?""
T.J. said ""Charley, it's just like you said.""

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
(Do you want it)
Yeah, it ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it, do you want it.

Yeah, it ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it.
Hey, do you want it..."
Temptation #9,Brooks & Dunn,Country,"Yeah I've been hurt and I've been blue
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the changes love has put me through
I've told myself it's got to end
I've had enough and I ain't goin' back again
I've watched 'em come
I've watched 'em go
Six, seven, eight and I can still say no
And then tonight you came along
Only a fool would wanna be that strong

Temptation #9 
Make a man wanna cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist

I walked alone, I played it safe
Tryin' not to count the times I walked away
'Cause when you love and love goes wrong
A broken heart just seems too much to gamble on
I first saw you, I had to think
Oh another pretty woman just what I don't need
But when I look into your eyes
Hey I see somethin' makes me wanna roll the dice

Temptation #9 
Make a man wanna cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist

Ooh you got it shakin'
Ooh there's no mistakin'
You're the next trip that I'll be takin'

The Ballad Of Jed Clampett,Flatt & Scruggs,Country,"Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed

Then one day he was shooting for some food,
And up through the ground come a bubbling crude

Kin folk said Jed move away from there
Said California is the place you oughta be
So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly

Standing Knee Deep In a River (Dying Of Thirst),Kathy Mattea,Country,"Friends I could count on, I could count on one hand
With a leftover finger or two
I took 'em for granted, let 'em all slip away
Now where they are I wish I knew

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

Sometimes I remember sweethearts I've known
Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger, oh, and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go?

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

So the sidewalk is crowded, the city goes by
And I rush through another day
And a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me
But I just look the other way

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst"
She Loved Me,Jason Aldean,Country,"It was the summer of '89, I fell in love and I learned to drive
Me and Becky didn't waste no time, went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old, we were heading down a dead end road
But we didn't care, we were on a roll. Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again...

We're living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it

Somebody's Someone,Lonestar,Country,"Turn to the six o'clock news, another soldier dies
Tried to hide it but I couldn't help it, I had to cry
When my little boy asked me daddy was he your friend
I said no, I didn't even know him.

But he was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone.

So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
How this brave young man gave his life for our land
And although he's someone we'll never know
To you and me he is a hero.

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone.

To the world he was a total stranger
Who kept us safe and out of danger
But now he's just a picture on TV
Somebody's memory.

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone.

He was somebody's someone..."
Lullaby,Dixie Chicks,Country,"They didn't have you where I come from
Never knew the best was yet to come

And I hear your laugh like a serenade

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up"
Blue Blue Day,Don Gibson,Country,"It's been a blue blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from it all

Well I feel like crying dying what can I do
I feel like praying saying I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from the blues

Yes how can I make believe that I don't sit and grieve it's been a blue blue day for me
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway it's been a blue blue day for me
Well I feel like crying...
I feel like runnin' away from the blues"
You're The Only One,Keith Urban,Country,"I know it's gonna take some time
For you to trust this love of mine
I know he broke your heart in two
You've been betrayed and ... you're afraid
That I will do the same to you

But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away
You ... You know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes

You can believe my every word... yes you can
Whatever heaven holds in store
Through good and bad ... I'll be your man
Stand beside you through it all

But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away
And you ... you know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes

Home,Eli Young Band,Country,"I've shed alot of years and tears
In this broke down used up town
Bled my heart on these city streets
As strangers lay their money down
I'm home

I've never known a love
My soul was searching for
Now I look into that great big blue
Feel nothing I've felt before 
I'm alone

So I'll shake some hands
Chase that calling star
I'm gonna drive so fast
I can only drive so far
Gonna lay my bricks
And park my car
Gonna sow my seeds somewhere
But home is where you are

See your washed out faded smiles
When I look back on this place
All that held me as a child
Is begging me to stay
But I'm gone

So I'll shake some hands
Chase that calling star
I'm gonna drive so fast
I can only drive so far
Gonna lay my bricks
And park my car
Gonna sow my seeds somewhere
But home is where you are

I'll follow that blinding sun 
What I can't see past
Knowing I can always go back home

So I'll shake some hands
Chase that calling star
I'm gonna drive so fast
I can only drive so far
Gonna lay my bricks
And park my car
Gonna sow my seeds somewhere
But home is where you are

Girl, that's where you are
It's where you are"

Slow Poke,Pee Wee King,Country,"You keep me waitin' till it's gettin' aggravatin'
You're a slow poke
I wait and worry but you never seem to hurry
You're a slow poke
Time means nothin' to you
I wait and then
You're late again, eight o'clock
Nine o'clock, quarter to ten

Why should I linger every time you snap your finger
Little slow poke
Why can't you hasten when you see the time's a-wastin'

A Mansion On The Hill,Hank Williams,Country,"Tonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome and oh, how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill

Do you recall when we parted?
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without loving
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
'Cause I know you're living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shine bright from yer window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill"
My Arms Stay Open All Night,Tanya Tucker,Country,"(Paul Overstreet/Don Schlitz)

I know you like the night-life, the parties and the fun.
You like to hang around until the last song has been sung.
So I have made arrangements and I wanted you to know,
When all the laughter's ended, there's still somewhere you can go.

My arms stay open all night,
From sundown till the morning light.
Hopin' you can find where you belong,
I leave the lights on.
My heart is never closed,
You're the only love it knows.
The one dream I have is to hold you tight:
My arms stay open all night.

Please don't think I'm crazy, I haven't lost my mind.
But when it comes to lovin' you, I can always find the time.
So if it's after midnight, or just before the break of day,
Anytime you need me, it'll never be too late.

'Cause my arms stay open all night,
From sundown till the morning light.
Hopin' you can find where you belong,
I leave the lights on.
My heart is never closed,
You're the only love it knows.
The one dream I have is to hold you tight:
My arms stay open all night.

When all your so-called friends go home,
You don't ever have to be alone.

'Cause my arms stay open all night,
From sundown till the morning light.
Hopin' you can find where you belong,
I leave the lights on.
My heart is never closed,
You're the only love it knows.
The one dream I have is to hold you tight:
My arms stay open all night.

My arms stay open all night."
Lonesome To The Bone,Johnny Cash,Country,"On the park bench I slept on
Raindrops are fallin' on the newspapers coverin' me
I hear early mornin' motors
And I know the world is wakin' for the dawn

But my mind's down a dark alley
Somewhere where last night you loved me
And in the early mornin' chill my arms remember still
But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone

I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone

Your hot breath and your laughter
Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone"
China Doll,Slim Whitman,Country,"I'm tired of crying and all your lying,
That's why I'm buying a china doll.
Her eyes are bluer, her faults are fewer,
Her lips are truer; my china doll.

I'd rather have a doll of clay
That I could call my own,
Than someone else just like you
With a heart of stone.

She'll never leave me.
She'll never grieve me,
I'll never lose her - 
My china doll.

I'd rather have a doll of clay

My china doll."
I Came Here To Live,Trace Adkins,Country,"I grew up in a town where tough was a cigarette
And a souped up car on a county road
Nothin' much to do back then
So we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
Learn to hold my own

Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
There was more to life than that
So I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
I didn't come here to die

Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy 'til I got home
Daddy he'd say listen son
But back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know

I reckon I was doing close to 80
When I felt the tire slip out from under me
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me
And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smokin' gas in my eyes
And He said son you came here to live
You didn't come here to die

Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
Met a girl in town put some money down
On a little house with a yard

Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was settin' there at his side
Sayin' son open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes
'Cause you came here to live
You didn't come here to die
Son you came here to live"
Tears On My Pillow,Lorrie Morgan,Country,"(Sylvester Bradford/Al Lewis)

You don't remember me, but I remember you
It was not so long ago, you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow pain in my heart caused by you, you, you, you

Love is not a gadget, love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
He'll fill you heart with joy

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back and tempt the hands of fate
Tears on my pillow pain in my heart caused by you, you

No, no no no now, no no no"
Healing Hands of Time,Willie Nelson,Country,"They're working while I'm missing you
Those healing hands of time
And soon they'll be dismissing you
From this heart of mine

They'll lead me safely through the night
And I'll follow as though blind
My future tightly clutched within
Those healing hands of time

They let me close my eyes just then
Those healing hands of time
And soon they'll let me sleep again
Those healing hands of time

So already I've reached mountain peaks
And I've just begun to climb
I'll get over you by clinging to
Those healing hands of time

I'll get over you by clinging to
Those healing hands of time"
What I've Got In Mind,Billie Jo Spears,Country,"There's a million things that we could do this evenin'
With all the night life and the silver screen
Oh, we've got time and we could take the town in
Or take a fast jet, baby, down to New Orleans

But what I've got in mind is a small cafe
Out of the way
Oh, baby, let's don't stay
No and be too late

What I've got in mind is to disappear
Or maybe just stay right here
Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is makin' love to you

Well, I confess and you can find me guilty
I'm a selfish lover I can't deny
But I love you and I don't want to share you
With any night lights or darlin', in another's eyes

But what I've got in mind is a small cafe
Out of the way
Oh, baby, let's don't stay
No and be too late

What I've got in mind is to disappear
Or maybe just stay right here
Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is makin' love to you

Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is makin' love to you"
Following Me Around,Willie Nelson,Country,"She always follows me from town to town
At least her mem'ries follow me around
And whenever I clear my mind so she can see
I feel her love come rushing into me

And I know that I will never be the law
Looks as though her memory's bound to haunt
And I know my love will always stay in bounds
With her memory always following me around

Following me around, following me around
Following me around, following me around
And I know my love will always stay in bounds
With her memory always following me around

Following me around, following me around
Following me around, following me around
And I know my love will always stay in bounds
With her memory always following me around
With her memory always following me around"
Amanda,Waylon Jennings,Country,"I've held it all inward, God knows, I've tried,
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,
To look in the mirror in total surprise.
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes. 

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life. 
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

It's a measure of people who don't understand,
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen, 
Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life. 
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife."
Tear My Stillhouse Down,The Nashville Bluegrass Band,Country,"Put no stone at my head, no flowers on my tomb
No gold-plated sign in a marble pillared room
That's one thing I want when they lay me in the ground
When I die, tear my Stillhouse down

When I was a lad way back in the hills
I laughed at the men who tended those stills
But that old mountain shine, they caught me somehow
When I die, tear my Stillhouse down

Oh, tear my Stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace at the hiding place where I made that evil stuff
For all my time and money, no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me

Go tell all your children, Hell ain't no dream
Satan, he lives in my whiskey machine
Oh, in my time of dying, I know where I'm bound
When I die, tear my Stillhouse down

Oh, tear my Stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace at the hiding place where I made that evil stuff
For all my time and money, no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me
That old copper kettle was the death of me"
Only The Wind,Billy Dean,Country,"I remember as a child on a dark stormy night
I heard the screendoor slam and I was overcome with fright
So afraid that someone bad was trying to get in
And momma came to comfort me and said
""It's only the wind, and nothing more
Not the end of the world knockin' at the door
So close your eyes and dream again
Believe me, It's only the wind""

Everytime I'e had to face a bitter storm of life
Those words of comfort were my shelter in the night
But tonight I don't believe I'm able to pretend
The storm that you and I are up against is only the wind

I can hear you downstairs and you're just about to leave
There's nothing else that I can do to keep you here with me, no
And now the screen door's slammin' and I'm frightened once again
What I wouldn't give if I could be convinced

It's only the wind, and nothing more
Not the end of the world walking out the door
I wish that I could dream again
Believin' it's only the wind
Oh, nothing more, not the end of my world
Walking out the door
I wish that I could dream again
Believin' it's only the wind
Only the wind"
Ten With A Two,Kenny Chesney,Country,"Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light
I lost my eyesight
I ain't been that drunk in awhile
Along about one I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
She was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I had died and gone to heaven
But Lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Well I made up my mind
I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Now you may laugh
But if you've got the cash
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you have too"
Solitary Thinkin',Lee Ann Womack,Country,"Well I only came into this bar
To hear a sad song
But I'll probably be here all night long
The way I'm feeling now

I couldn't get you on the phone
So, I let it ring
On and on in a lonesome serenade

Ooh, what am I gonna do about my problems now
Maybe I should try to find a way to kinda, sorta, maybe, work it out

Ooh, with some solitary thinkin'
And lonesome drinkin'
Ooh, it sure does make a body feel at home
And a double barrel whiskey
And oh baby, tell me do you miss me
Some solitary thinkin' and lonesome drinkin' for me tonight

There's two things that'll kill a girl
They'll strike her down right where she stands
One is his voice and one is the rock glass sitting in my hand

Ooh, lights are gettin' dimmer now
That means they gonna shut me down
And it's just like crystal
It ain't always really clear

Tell me baby now
How am I gonna get myself to sleep now that you're gone
Maybe I should try to find a way to kinda think about carrying on
On my own"
One Hell Of A Woman,Mac Davis,Country,"Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way.
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better loking each day.
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
I used to have a girlfriend
But she just couldn't compete
With all of these love starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet.
Well I prob'ly could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me.
Who cares, I never get lonesome
'Cause I treasure my own company.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way,
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
I guess you could say I'm a loner,
A cowboy outlaw tough and proud.
I could have lots of friends if I want to
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd.
Some folks say that I'm egotistical.
Hell, I don't even know what that means.
I guess it has something to do with the way that I
Fill out my skin tight blue jeans.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way,
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
We're doing the best that we can"
Hard Road,Lucinda Williams,Country,"How long have you been hangin' around
Your eyes fixed to the cement ground
Your heart is warm, your hands are cold
You know the truth, but the story gets old
You stood on the corner for a long time
People passin' by you gave you nickels and dimes
They think you're one of the nameless
'Cause you got no record and you ain't famous

Oh, Bill, I know how you're feelin'
Your heart's on fire and your head is reelin'

And a friend beside you
You know you'll win

Work To Do,Allison Moorer,Country,"I got a lot of work to do
Got to give you back your point of view

It's just not mine
So I got a lot of work to do

I got a lot of space to fill
'Cause I'm throwing out what he will
Here in my head
The things you said
So I got a lot of space to fill

It seems like every time I turn around
You put me down
Over and over again I let you tell me
How I'm not good enough
That ain't love

It goes ringin' in my mind
Don't hold the truth I know
I just keep on tryin' till those lies you told me
Fade on out of sight
If it takes time of mine

I got a lot of work to do
Got to give you back your point of view
It suits you fine
It's just not mine
So I got a lot of work to do"
Still Pretending,Tift Merritt,Country,"I hear you coming up the driveway.
I tie a ribbon in my hair.
Look who's come to see me.
Funny, you always end up here.

But it's still pretending.
And it's still wrong.
And I still can't tell my heart
Why I'm still alone.

Well I guess I'm supposed to lock you out.
Well I guess I'm supposed to play it tough.
But I see how you look at me --
Baby, it always is enough.

But it's still pretending.
And it's still wrong.
And I still can't tell my heart
Why I'm still alone.

Barefoot in the kitchen laughing,
Till you leave, when I'll be crying
Inside the door I close behind you,
Wishing you would stay.

But we're still pretending.
And we're still wrong.
And I still can't tell my heart
Why I'm still alone.

Oh tell my why, I'm still alone.
Oh, why I'm still alone."
Worried Man Blues,The Original Carter Family,Country,"It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

I went across the river I lay down to sleep
I went across the river I lay down to sleep
When I woke up, put the shackles on my feet

29 links of chain around my leg
29 links of chain around my leg
And on each link an initial of my name

It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

I asked the judge, what might be my fine
I asked the judge, what might be my fine
21 years on the R. C. Mountain Line

The train arrived, 16 coaches long
The train arrived, 16 coaches long
The girl I love is on that train and gone

It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

If anyone ask you who composed this song
If anyone ask you who composed this song
Tell 'em 'twas I, and I sing it all day long

It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long"
Hey Jezebel,Allison Moorer,Country,"Don't you look pretty
Dressed to the nines
Comfortably sitting on your gold mine
Blood red and blonde
Lipstick and curls
A high-heeled Don Juan
Come to mess up my world.

All of the ladies are watching their backs
The boys thinking maybe they might stand a chance
Bet every bar you walk in's the same
They don't know who you are
But they sure know your name.

Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone.

Why'd you come calling on this side of town
A woman who's fallen and keeps going down
I won't compete with your dirty work
So get back to the street
Before you get hurt.

Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone.

This southern belle is tough as nails
Leave mine alone."
How Many Days,Jack Ingram,Country,"J. Lauderdale/T. McBride

I know why you asked me here
You're not sure the coast is clear
You're about to speak your mind
This small talk is a bad sign

How many days have I been here tonight
How many days have I been here tonight

You keep stalling probably
Stretch it to eternity
Can't feel guilty say your lines
Breakin' my hearts not a crime

I can't stand the suspense
How long can I go on like this
How many days have I been here tonight

I can't stand the suspense
How long can I go on like this
How many days have I been here tonight

How many days have I been here tonight
Since I've been here tonight"
December Day,Willie Nelson,Country,"This looks like a December day
This looks like a ""time to remember"" day
And I remember the spring, such a sweet tender thing
And love's summer college
Where the green leaves of knowledge
Were waiting to fall with the Fall

And where September wine
Numbed the measure of time
Through the tears of October, now November's over
And this looks like a December day

This looks like a December day
It looks like we've come to the end of the way
And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

And this looks like a December day"
I Just Came Home To Count The Memories,Cal Smith,Country,"I saw roses choking in the grass
Flaking paint and a broken window pane
A mailbox barely standing by the driveway
I can almost see the name

A swing set and forgotten toys where
Little girls and boys played happy games
Everything I ever cared about is gone now
But the memory still remains

The old man from the house across the street asked
How's it going and I said fine
The expression on his face would make me think
He could almost read my mind

That Johnson boy from down the road was asking
If the kids could come and play
Lord I wish I could have told him yes but I
Just said I guess son not today

I just came home to count the memories
That I've been counting in my mind
I just came home to count the memories
From a better day and time

Birds that sang their pretty songs
Aren't singing like they did when we were here
Cause there's no happiness in music if somebody
Isn't close enough to care

I picked a ragged daisy from it's home
Out in the corner of the yard
She loves me she loves me not now I don't
Have to wonder anymore

I guess it's time to say goodbye"
Whenever I Run,Keith Urban,Country,"I've seen that darkness on the edge of town
The sun come up and the rain fall down
And I've been a fool, yeah I've been around

And when the world got too much for me
I took off and left a memory
Thinking I'd find something better for me somehow
Oh but now

Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
Is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to

I used to quit when it got too tough
Throw in my cards when I was down on my luck
But baby you mean too much to me
So now

Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
Is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to

I never could stay in one place too long
I never could stand that still
Ah but you changed so much in me
And now I know I will

I'm gonna stay where the love is right
I'm so tired of being a bird in flight
Good love takes work
Ah but that's alright
That's alright

Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
Is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to

You're the only one
Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
That's where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to
The one I run to
The one I run to"
She Didn't Even Know I Was Gone,The Louvin Brothers,Country,"O mister, let me stay a while and talk with you
I know it's time to lock the door; the dance is through
But maybe you can tell me how to take this pain
Or maybe this has happened once to you

Yesterday I owned the world, the ocean, and the shore
My baby said she'd never make me hurt anymore
Tonight we planned to mention our engagement at the dance
I wish we'd never come through that door

The music started playing and she walked away
My heart was crying loud but not a word could I say
She danced with him all night and they helped sing every song
She didn't even know I was gone

I waited at the door until the dance was through
I had to know for sure that what I'd seen was true
She cuddled in his arms and then they walked out of sight
She didn't even tell me goodnight

Yesterday I owned the world, the ocean, and the shore
My baby said she'd never make me hurt anymore
Tonight we planned to mention our engagement at the dance
I wish we'd never come through that door

The music started playing and she walked away
My heart was crying loud but not a word could I say
She danced with him all night and they helped sing every song
She didn't even know I was gone"
Forty Hour Week (For A Livin'),Alabama,Country,"There are people in this country 
Who work hard every day
Not for fame or fortune do they strive
But the fruits of their labor 
Are worth more than their pay
And it's time a few of them were recognized.

Hello Detroit auto workers, 
Let me thank you for your time
You work a forty hour week for a livin', 
Just to send it on down the line
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, 
Let me thank you for your time
You work a forty hour week for a livin', 
Just to send it on down the line.

This is for the one who swings the hammer, 
Driving home the nail
Or the one behind the counter, 
Ringing up the sale
Or the one who fights the fires, 
The one who brings the mail
For everyone who works behind the scenes.

You can see them every morning 
In the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around.

Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, 
Let me thank you for your time
You work a forty hour week for a livin', 
Just to send it on down the line
Hello West Virginia coal miner, 
Let me thank you for your time
You work a forty hour week for a livin', 
Just to send it on down the line.

This is for the one who drives the big rig, 
Up and down the road
Or the one out in the warehouse, 
Bringing in the load
Or the waitress, the mechanic, 
The policeman on patrol
For everyone who works behind the scenes.

With a spirit you can't replace with no machine
Hello America, let me thank you for your time..."
Make The World Go Away,Ray Price,Country,"Oh make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
It goes bigger day by day please make the world go away
I was wrong the day I left you and let the world leave me astray
If you'll say that you forgive me you'll make the world go away
Oh make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
I go weaker day by day please make the world go away
I'm sorry that I hurt you I'll make it up day by day
Can you love me like you used to and make the world go away
Make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
Can you love me like you used to and make the world go away
Say the things you used to say and make the world go away
I can't stand another day please make the world go away
Say you'll take me back to stay and make the world go away"
The Blues Man,Alan Jackson,Country,"He's just a singer, a natural born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger, to sad old songs
He's not a walk-behinder, he's a new note finder
His name's a reminder, of a blues man that's already gone

So he started drinkin', and took some things that messed up his thinkin'
He was sure sinkin', when she came along
He was alone in the spot light, not to much left inside
She changed all that one nigh, when she sang him this song  

Hey baby I love you, hey baby I need you
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine a little love light, down on that blues man

He got so sick from speed 'n, all the things hey said he was needin'
If he was to keep on pleasin', all of his fans
He got cuffed on dirt roads, he got sued over no shows
She came and took all that old load, down off of that blues man, and he sang

Hey baby I love you too, hey baby I need you
Hey baby I do get tired, of this travelin' band
I'm over 40 years old now, nights would be cold now 
If you hadn't stuck it out, with this blues man

He's over 40 years old now, nights would be so cold now
If she hadn't hung around, with that blues man"
I Can't Lie To Me,Clay Davidson,Country,"They don't ask 'cause they know I'll say
It ain't nothin' just another woman done walked away
Still on track, no I ain't fazed
I rock on all night long just playing this masquerade

Well, I've got everybody thinkin' I'm superman strong
But that big ole ""S"" ain't on my chest at night when I get home
One look at my reflection and lonely's all I see
I can tell 'em all I'm glad you're gone
But the truth is I can't lie to me

Call you up and get shot down
Throw my pride aside and I just cry out loud
Called my bluff, now just look at me
A fool in love and all tore up
Down here on my knees

Well, I've got everybody thinkin' I'm superman strong
But that big ole ""S"" ain't on my chest at night when I get home
One look at my reflection and lonely's all I see
I can tell 'em all I'm glad you're gone
But the truth is I can't lie to me

Oh the truth is I can't lie to me."
I Stayed Long Enough,Tammy Wynette,Country,"Accident'ly in your arms and that's all it took
Knowing how you want and need me with just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
Just lookin' won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Yes everything I need...
I stayed just long enough to fall in love with you"
I'll Never Find Another You,Sonny James,Country,"There's a new world somewhere they call the Promised Land
And I'll be there someday if you will hold my hand
I still need you there beside me no matter what I do
For I know I'll never find another you
There is always someone to reach across they say
And you'll be my someone forever and today
I could search the whole world over until my life is through
But I know I'll never find another you
It's a long long journey so stay by my side
When I'll walk through the storm you'll be my guide be my guide
If they gave me a fortune my pleasure would be small
I could lose it all tomorrow and never mind at all
But if I should lose your love dear I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you
But if I should lose your love dear I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you another you another you"
Sixteen Tons,Merle Travis,Country,"Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said: ""Well, a-bless my soul!""

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store"
Send Down An Angel,Allison Moorer,Country,"It's nearly 3 a.m.
And still, no sight of him
When it comes to love
I'm in the dark
Lord, I don't understand
Why I stand by my man
All he's ever done
Is break my heart.

Won't you send down an angel
From the blue to show me
The righteous thing to do

To ge me through
I'm not the praying kind but
It can't hurt to try.

I can't find the answer by myself
I need help"
You Don't Do It,Tanya Tucker,Country,"Every now and then you feel like jumping off the deep end
Pack a few things head to New Orleans, commit a few sins
With a good rockin' daddy that can rock all night
Make you feel good, make you feel all right
You don't do it, baby, but you think about it

You wanna spend your life, your love and your money in the fast lane
Let the good times roll, body and soul ruin the family name

I know what he's sayin' 'cause I've been there too
You don't do it, baby, but you think about it
Well we all got a list of the do's and don'ts

Save a little space for the wills and won'ts
Underline things like right and wrong
I could just go on and on and on

Yeah you want to get crazy girl, and there's no doubt
That somebody's doing what you're doing without
But you don't do it, baby, you just think about it

Breakin' It,Mindy McCready,Country,"If there was anyway out
Where I could slip away 
And take my heart with me
If there was anyway out 
Where I could slip away
And leave my mind at ease
'Cause if my head was on right
You wouldn't be sittin' here tonight
Watchin' me shakin' it
But if my heart was intact
You know I'd let you have the first crack
At breakin' it

If you were anything less 
Than what you are to me
Well I would have a reason then
Callin' it quits
Instead of havin' these fits
Over where you've been
And if the love that you stole
Wasn't still the best I've known
I wouldn't be takin' it 
And if my heart was intact
You know I'd let you have the first crack
At breakin' it

If my body didn't burn
Everytime a head didn't turn
I wouldn't be fakin' it 
Oh no
And if my heart was intact
You know I'd let you have the first crack
At breakin' it

Oh 

Oh if my head was on right
You wouldn't be sittin' here tonight
Watchin' me shakin' it
Oh no
And if my heart was intact
You know I'd let you have the first crack
At breakin' it"
Help Me Make It Through the Night,Charley Pride,Country,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall

Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night

I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone"
I'm Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes,Dolly Parton,Country,"Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
Who is sailing all over the sea
And I'm thinking tonight of him only
And I wonder does he ever think of me

Could been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world had never met
For the pain and the pleasures he's brought me
I am sure I will never forget

So I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes...

Oh you told me once dear that you love me
And you swore that we never would part
But a linking the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad broken heart

Yes I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
And I wonder does he ever think of me"
Cold Hearted Woman,Cross Canadian Ragweed,Country,"She's got a smile a million miles long
Got a trail of cryin' and leavin' songs
You don't know and you don't care
You're completely unaware
Sometimes I wanna rip out your heart
And see if something's there

Cold hearted woman
You're bringing me down in flames
Runnin' around all over town
Runnin' down my name
Gonna get me a loaded pistol
Wait, was that out loud?
Cold hearted woman
I'm gonna put you in the ground

When the money comes rollin'
I can do no wrong
When the river stops flowin'
She's burnin' up the telephone
And by the time that I find you
Yeah my money' all down the drain
Burnt it up on cheap motels
And 8 balls of cocaine

Cold hearted woman
What goes around comes around"
Three Hearts In A Tangle,Roy Drusky,Country,"Three hearts in a tangle one heart will have to break
Tonight as I sit by my window watching the people go by
I'm trying to reach a decision but I know I can't do what's right
Three hearts in a tangle which heart should I take
Three hearts in a tangle which heart will I break

If I choose the one that I should choose then the other heart would break
But if I'll leave them both then I'd suffer which heart will pay for my mistake
Three hearts in a tangle..."
A Boy Named Sue,Johnny Cash,Country,"Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!"
Addicted To A Dollar,Doug Stone,Country,"Eighty hours a week, that's what I call work
And this black under my blue collar is his best pay dirt.
They work me hard from dawn to dusk
Doin' double time puttin' out sweat for a filthy buck.

F.I.C.A. and the state
They make my paycheck look like a big mistake.
Tax man takes his before I see a cent
And what they don't get, I've already spent.

I'm addicted to a dollar, that ain't worth a dime.
I pick up my paycheck and pass it on down the line.
The more money that I'm making, the less I can call mine.
Well, I'm addicted to a dollar, that ain't worth a dime.

Got me more payments than I've got checks.
Ten more to go on this car, it's a wreck.
Landlord's at my door, it's a life of hard knocks.
When all I really want is my piece of the rock."
Bloody Mary Morning,Willie Nelson,Country,"It's a Bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flyin' down to Houston
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight

As we taxi toward the runway
With the smog and haze
Reminding me of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learnin'
That the pitfalls of the city
Are extremely real

All the night life and the parties
And temptation and deceit
The order of the day
Well, it's a Bloody Mary mornin'
'Cause I'm leavin' baby somewhere in L.A.

It's a Bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flyin' down to Houston
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight

Our golden jet is airborne
And flight 50 cuts a path
Across the mornin' sky
And a voice comes on the speaker
Reassuring us flight 50
Is the way to fly

And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea or something stronger
To start off the day
Well, it's a Bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leavin' baby somewhere in L.A.

It's a Bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flyin' down to Houston
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight"
From a Jack To a King,Ned Miller,Country,"From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
And walked away with your heart

From a Jack to a King
With no regret I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
To make me King of your heart
For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart

She Used To Be Mine,Brooks & Dunn,Country,"She looked so good movin' 'cross the dance floor
Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holdin' hands and laughin' like we used to
I got my best smile on, but it's no disguise
It don't hide the pain in these eyes

I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part, to break her heart
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine

It's taken every bit of strength that I have
To keep a hurt look off of my face
I can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder
At the lucky man takin' my place
Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off runnin'
Guess what I'm feelin', is what I got comin'

I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part, to break her heart
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine

I did her so wrong, for so long

Love In The First Degree,Alabama,Country,"I once thought of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree

I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If lovin' you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree

Love in the first degree

And say, ""I'm sorry

My friends don't know what they've done
And, well

Next In Line,Johnny Cash,Country,"The next in line will be someone who loves you
The next in line is me, 'cause it's my time
Now how long will it be, till you end my misery
You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
Come to me now, so I can make you mine
I watched them rush to you so fast
I waited so I'd be the last
It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line

The next in line will want your love forever
The next in line is me and here I am
Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
This old heart can't take much more waitin' for your love
I'm tired and we're runnin' short of time
I'll make you love me more than everyone before
It's my time to try, 'cause I'm the next in line

I stood and watched you take their hearts
And break 'em one by one
My time is comin', so I waited while you had your fun
Now I'm through a-waitin' way behind
It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line"
Touch Too Much,Hayseed Dixie,Country,"It was one of those nights when you turn out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time, I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

It wasn't the first, wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel, smiling with sin
The body of Venus with arms
Dealin' with danger, strokin' my skin
Like a thunder and lightening storm

It wasn't the first, wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard, wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She has a touch, a touch too much
Touch me!

Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much (much too much)
I really wanna feel ya (touch too much)
Girl, you know you're givin' me (much too much)

Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch

A touch too much

He Was A Friend Of Mine,Willie Nelson,Country,"He was a friend of mine
Every time I think of him
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause he was a friend of mine

He died on the road
He died on the road
He just kept on moving
Never reaped what he could sow
And he was a friend of mine

I stole away and cried
I stole away and cried
'Cause I never had too much money
And I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine

He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
A thousand miles from home
And he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine

He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I hear his name Lord
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause he was a friend of mine."
Everybody's Sweetheart,Vince Gill,Country,"When I told my baby do what you wanna do
Well I had no idea just what she'd put me through
Every night she's runnin' round singin' songs in your hometown
There ain't no one to love me when the sun goes down

Well she's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine
I should've kept her barefoot, barefoot and pregnant all the time
Well I used to be the first in line but now I've fallen way behind
She's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine

All that country club money, Lord, it sure looked good to me, yeah it did
Playing golf with those fat cats how much better could life be
They all think I've got it made they see your face on every page
Of every magazine across the U.S.A.

Well she's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine
I should've kept her barefoot, barefoot and pregnant all the time
Well I used to be the first in line but now I've fallen way behind
She's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine

If you see her tell her, ""Hi""
And everything will be all right
Tell her that I love her till the day I die

Well she's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine
I should've kept her barefoot, barefoot and pregnant all the time
Well I used to be the first in line but now I've fallen way behind
She's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine
She's everybody's sweetheart, everybody's sweetheart but mine

Come on home..."
Fox On The Run,Tom T. Hall,Country,"She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run

Now everybody knows the reason for my fall
A woman tempted me down in paradise hall
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride


Like a lonely fox, boys, I need a place to hide

Oh, we'll drink a glass of wine, boys, to purify our soul
We'll talk about the world and the friends we used to know
I see a string of girls who have put me on before
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at the door"
Texas (When I Die),Tanya Tucker,Country,"When I die I may not go to heaven
I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boy!
Texas is as close as I've been

New York couldn't hold my attention
Detroit City couldn't sing my song
If tomorrow finds me busted flat in Dallas
I won't care, 'cause at least I'll know I'm home

When I die I may not go to heaven
I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boy!
Texas is as close as I've been.

I'd ride through all of Hell and half of Texas
Just to hear Willie Nelson sing a country song
Beer just ain't as cold in old Milwaukee
My body's here, but my soul's in San Antone

When I die I may not go to heaven
I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boy!
Texas is as close as I've been

When I die I may not go to heaven
I don't know if they let cowboys in
If they don't just let me go to Texas, boy!
Texas is as close as I've been"
Heart Trouble,Martina McBride,Country,"The way you treat me baby
Cheat and tell me lies
I guess I shouldn't care at all
But still I sympathize
'Cause you've got heart trouble
Coming on
Yeah you got heart trouble coming on
Well you think that you don't need me baby
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You feel no pain at all
You think that you're above it baby
But I believe you'll fall
'Cause you've got heart trouble coming on
Yeah you got heart trouble coming on
Well, you'll get down on your knees baby
Begging me to come back home

You tell me you'll find someone else
But on one's gonna care
'Cause you have left a trail
Of broken hearts everywhere
Now, you'll got heart trouble coming on
Yeah, You'll got heart trouble coming on
Well you'll know just how it feels baby
When you're left here all alone"
Love Will,Tanya Tucker,Country,"(Byron Hill/Cyril Rawson)

Money won't dry your tears
And words ain't always true
Flowers are nice to look at
But they won't satisfy you

But, honey, love will
Honey; love will
A whole lotta good things won't
But, honey, love will

Candy won't give you sweet dreams
Letters can't hold you tight
Phone calls - they can't touch you
Or keep you warm at night

But, honey, love will
Honey; love will
A whole lotta good things won't
But, honey, love will


You may stop your heart from fallin'
All in self-defense
When all you need is somethin'
To build your confidence

Honey, love will
True love will
A whole lotta good things won't
But, honey, love will

You may stop your heart from fallin'
All in self-defense
When all you need is somethin'
To build your confidence

Don't think that it won't
'Cause, honey, love will"
Whatever Made You Change Your Mind,The Derailers,Country,"I can't believe that you would walk out on me
Why did you tell me that you loved me?
What did I do to make you treat me so unkind?

Whatever made you change your mind?

Your love for me has changed, without a reason why
You said you needed me, I guess that was a lie
'Cause now today I find, you're leaving me behind

Whatever made you change your mind?

You're not the same as the day you took my name
And now you're slipping through my fingers
It seems like yesterday that all your love was mine

Whatever made you change your mind?

You said we'd work it out, I think that's only fair
I gave my life to you, now you don't even care
And now today I find, you're leaving me behind
Whatever made you change your mind?
Whatever made you change your mind?"
Burgers And Fries,Charley Pride,Country,"Burgers and fries and cherry pies, it was simple and good back then
Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end
Making our love with the moon above at the drive in picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know

Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
All the things we used to say, little things we did each day
Oh I long to do the things that we did before

When it was burgers and fries and cherry pies, it was simple and good back then
Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end
Making our love with the moon above at the drive in picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know

Well I'm still the same old me, that's all I'll ever be
I'd like to think that you're the same old you
We lost something down the line that I wish we both could find
Lord I'd like to do the things that we used to do

When it was burgers and fries and cherry pies, it was simple and good back then
Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end
Making our love with the moon above at the drive in picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know"
I Feel Sorry For Him,Willie Nelson,Country,"There goes the man who gave his heart to someone,
I feel sorry for him.
For that someone just gave her to me.
Now, he's the loser an' it hurts so much to lose.
An' I feel sorry for him,
'Cause the loser, I know, could have been me. 

Oh, how he loved her:
I'm sure he must have loved her almost as much as me.
But fate has frowned on him,
Then turned around and smiled on me. 

There goes a man who gave his heart to someone,
I feel sorry for him.
'Cause that someone just gave her to me.  

If things were different:
If he had won her heart instead of me,
I wonder if he'd find the time,
To offer sympathy. 

There goes a man who gave his heart to someone,
I feel sorry for him.
For that someone just gave her to me."
Anything's Better Than Feelin' The Blues,Martina McBride,Country,"(Matrica Berg/Randy Scruggs)

I sent myself a dozen roses
Right before the office closes
Just to make my girlfriends green with envy
Ever since I lost you
All the crazy things I do
I didn't even know I had it in me... Oh but

Hey it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody... got no nothin' to lose
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Spread a little misery round
Anything's better than feelin' the blues

Found a restaurant on my way
Told 'em it was my birthday
Just to hear the waiters sing off-key
I've sprung a loose wire... that's a fact
Got a strange little monkey on my back
But I kinda like the company... and I guess

Hey, it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody... got no nothin' to lose.
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Dance the little monkey around
Anything's better than feelin' the blues

Hey it's all right.
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody... got no nothin' to lose.
I'm gonna get dressed up and go down town
Live it up and never live it down
Anything's better than feelin' the blues
Anything's better than feelin' the blues"

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh,
Oer the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Just get a bob-tailed nag
Two-forty for his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,

In a one-horse open sleigh.

Just One Time,Connie Smith,Country,"If I could see you just one time oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time and then pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so they now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine wish I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh how I miss you so oh I need you so
I I I'd give this heart of mine wish I could see you just one time

Wish I could relive just one time turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine wish I could see you just one time

There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio,Aaron Tippin,Country,"Sometimes she runs, sometimes she don't 
More than once she's left me on the side of the road
The older she gets, the slower we go
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

She needs a carburetor, a set of plug wires
She's riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

I've got sixteen speakers crossin' my back dash
A little bobbin' dog watchin' everybody pass
Dual attennas whippin' in the wind
Lord, there ain't a country station that I can't tune in
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

I got stopped by a cop late last night
Out-of-date tags and no tail lights
He said, ""I oughta run you in, but I'm lettin' you go 
Because there ain't nothin' wrong with your radio""

Got the best lookin' gal in my hometown
I asked her last time that I took her out
Honey, tell me what it is that makes you love me so
She said, ""there ain't nothin' wrong with your radio""

I've got sixteen speakers crossin' my back dash
A little bobbin' dog watchin' everybody pass
Dual attennas a-whippin' in the wind

But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

No, she ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls

My Pillow,Roger Miller,Country,"Pillow you're catching my tears again
Why can't these lonely nights come to an end
I once loved someone, but now she is gone
Oh why must I cry on and on

Pillow you're catching all of my blues
I lay here crying every night through
She won't even write me, or call on the phone
Oh why must I cry on and on

Darling, oh darling, wherever you are
Come back, oh come back
Don't wander too far

Pillow I guess we'll go through it tonight
I can't help my feelings, I can't hold them back
I know it's foolish, and I know she's gone
Oh why must I cry on and on"
I Saw the Light,Hank Williams,Country,"I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light."
Blueberry Hill,Gene Autry,Country,"I found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's Sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill"
Eighteen Wheels And A Dozen Roses,Kathy Mattea,Country,"Charlie's got a gold watch
Don't seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of driving up and down the interstate
But Charlie's had a good life 
And Charlie's got a good wife
And after tonight she'll no longer be counting the days

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves

They'll buy a Winnebago
Set out to find America
They'll do a lot of catching up a little at a time
With pieces of the old dream
They're gonna light the old flame
Doing what they please, leaving every other reason behind

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves

The past we knew I'll not reveal

My heart may cry with every beat
Without your love I'm not complete
It doesn't matter how I feel
My lips are sealed.

Not one single tear
And ever after
Let your fears disappear.

Forget the past I led you through
Just don't look back it's all concealed
My lips are sealed.

(Turn Out The Light And) Love Me Tonight,Don Williams,Country,"I've been lonesome
I've been empty
I got an achin'
Way down inside
I need someone
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door

I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight


Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight

It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door

'57 Chevrolet,Billie Jo Spears,Country,"Come and look at this old faded photograph
Honey, tell me what it brings to mind
It's a picture of that '57 Chevrolet
I wish that we could ride it one more time

I still get excited when I think about
The drive-in picture shows you took me to
But I don't recall a lot about the movie stars
Mostly that old Chevrolet and you

They don't make cars like they used to
I wish we still had it today
The love we first tasted, the good love we're still living
We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet

Remember when we used to park it in the lane
And listen to the country radio
We'd hold on to each other while the singer sang
And we'd stay like that 'til it was time to go

Now it makes me sad to think the good old days are gone
Although our love is still as strong today
But the world would have a lot more lovers hanging on
If they still made '57 Chevrolets

They don't make cars like they used to
I wish we still had it today
The love we first tasted, the good love we're still living
We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet

We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet
We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet
We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet"
The Battle Of New Orleans,Johnny Horton,Country,"In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down the river and we seed the British come
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire till we seed their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em
Well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em

Wine Into Water,T. Graham Brown,Country,"You've heard a multitude of prayers on my behalf

I Know Love Is All I Need,RODNEY CROWELL,Country,"So I'm an orphan now out here on my own
And it's hard to know where I belong
It comes as no surprise, it happens to us all
Just like the sun will rise night will fall

I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
That's all I know

An image I recall a picture on the wall of my mother on her wedding day
Young and naive nothing up her sleeve
But the things that just got lost along the way

And I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
That's all I know

There's a voice I hear it comes in loud and clear
It's my father's voice teaching me
He says to be a man you've got to be true to your word
And when you make a stand you'll be heard

And I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
That's all I know

I can see it in my children
I can feel it with my wife
And I know it with these friends I have
So important to my life

I had a dream last night 
I saw my mom and dad 
They were happy now and I was glad
They had a brand new house that they'd just moved in
And when I awoke they were gone again

But I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
I know love is all I need
That's all I know"
Hot Rod Lincoln,Asleep At The Wheel,Country,"My pappy said, 'Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that - Hot ... Rod ... Lincoln!'

Have you heard the story of the hot rod race,
When the Ford and the Lincolns were settin' the pace?
That story's true I'm here to say,
'Cause I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up;
And that Model A body makes it look like a pup.
It's got 8 cylinders and uses 'em all;
Got overdrive that just won't stall.

With 4-barrel carbs and a dual exhaust,
And 4:11 gears, you can really get lost -
Got safety too but I ain't scared,
The brakes are good and the tires fair.

We pulled out of San Pedro late one night;
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up ol' Grapevine Hill,
Passin' cars like they were standin' still.

All of a sudden, in the wink of an eye,
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said boys, ""That's a mark for me.""
By then, the taillights was all you could see.

Now, the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make that Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and, man alive,
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Well, I wound it up to 110;
My speedometer said that I'd hit top end.
My foot was glued like lead to the floor;
That's all there is - there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought that I'd lost my sense;
And them telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down, I see spots.""
The lines on the road just looked like dots.

We took a corner, side swiped a truck;
And I crossed my fingers just for luck -
And my was fenders clickin' the guard rail post;
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and I thought I could pass
Don't ya know by then, we'd be low on gas.

I had flames comin' from out of the side;
You could feel the tension; man, what a ride.
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

All of a sudden she started a-knockin';
Down in the depths she started a-rockin'.
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin';
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln.

Well they arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, 'Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin',
If you don't stop drivin' that - Hot ... Rod ... Lincoln!'"
Cattle Call,Tex Ritter,Country,"When the cattle are prowlin'
And the coyotes are howlin'
Under the western sky
The cowboy is singin'
His spurs are a-jinglin'
As on the trail he rides

Woo... hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo... hoo, hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Woo... hoo, hoo hoo hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo, hoo, hoo

Many hours will he ride
On the trail far and wide
He's goin' home this fall
Don't care 'bout the weather
His heart's light as a feather
He sings to the cattle this call

When the new day is dawning
And he wakes up yawning
Making his coffee strong
Makes his bed in a roll
Down the trail he will stroll
Singing his cattle the his song

When the cattle are bedded
And the saddle horse shedded
Nothing seems to be wrong
He casts up his eyes
To the stars in the skies
He sings to the cattle this song"
Country Girl,Dottie West,Country,"I was born a country girl; I will die a country girl
My world is made of blue skies and sunshine
Green fields and butterflies
I'm so glad I'm a country girl
Birds sing good morning to a country girl
And I sleep to the sounds of whip-o-wills
My day is made with puppies and kittens meadows and daisies
I'm so glad I'm a country girl
Running over hills playing in the woods free breezes blowing
Honey bees are swarming, black birds are flying, wonder where they're going
Picking stick-me-tights off my gingham dress darkness is falling
Firewood to carry eggs to gather and supper's ready mamma's calling
I was born a country girl and I will die a country girl
My world is made of blue skies and sunshine
Green fields and butterflies
I'm so glad I'm a country girl
Oh I'm so happy I'm a country girl"
What's He Doin' In My World,Eddy Arnold,Country,"What's he doin' in my world what's he doin' holdin' my world
If he's not more than just a friend why were you kissin' him
And what's he doin' in my world

What's he doin' in my world did you tell him that you're my girl
If your love is really true tell him my world's made for two
What's he doin' in my world

Oh don't let me keep on wonderin' just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love loves somebody new

What's he doin' in my world we don't need him here in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend explain those kisses you gave him
And what's he doin' in my world"
Hands Of Time,Steve Wariner,Country,"Runnin' down the interstate
Coffee drippin' down my leg
Every day I'm runnin' late
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.

Next lane there's a pick-up
A girl puttin' on her make-up
Her cellular phone's startin' to break up
She's gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.

Everybody's runnin' a little late like me
The whole world's runnin' behind
Can't seem to get where we need to be
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.

Here comes a carpool
Mama's got her hands full
Six kids all late for school
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.

Just passed the governor's motorcade
Must've had a flat tire on the way
I guess everybody's got to wait
When you're slapped around by the hands of time.

Everybody's runnin' a little late like me
The whole world's runnin' behind
Can't seem to get where we need to be
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.

Well everybody's runnin' a little late like me
The whole world's runnin' behind
Can't seem to get where we need to be

One Piece At A Time,Johnny Cash,Country,"Well I left Kentucky back in '49 and
Went to Detroit workin' on the assembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it outta there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least 100 grand

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out my buddy's mobile home
Now up to now my plan went all right
Till we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that somethin' was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53 and
The motor turned out to be a '73 and
When we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit and
With a little bit of help from an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all 3 of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
About that time my wife walked out and
I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said
""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove uptown just to get the tags and
I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff and
When they got through the title weighed 60 pounds

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

Uh, yeah, Red Rider
This is the Cotton Mouth
In the Psycho-Billy Cadillac Come on

Huh, This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there Red Rider
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh!, what model is it?

Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58' 59' automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67
'68, '69, '70 automobile"

Do You Love As Good As You Look,Bellamy Brothers,Country,"Long blonde hair
Sky blue eyes
Yeah, that well bred look is easy to recognize

A tailored dress
Fits so fine
And it adds up to the question on my mind 

Honey, do you love as good as you look?
Can you satisfy your man
Like your body says you can?
Judging from the cover
I'd love to read the book
Honey, do you love as good as you look?

If you could read my mind
You might blush blood red
But then again you might come over here instead

I see they brought your check
And soon you're bound to go

Should I Come Home (Or Should I Go Crazy),Gene Watson,Country,"I wonder if you've had the time it takes to think it over
To sort out all the feelings in your mind
Sometimes I think you've found someone to do your thinking for you
'Cause lately you've been showing all the signs.

Should I come home, or should I go crazy?
I'm beggin' you please, make up your mind.
If you love me, then think it all over.
So make up your mind, or I'll lose mine.

Last night when I came by, I rang the bell and no one answered,
But I heard voices whisper through the door
Now I'm not sure if anyone was home to do the talking
'Cause lately I hear voices more and more.

Should I come home, or should I go crazy?
I'm beggin' you please, make up your mind.
If you love me, then think it all over.
So make up your mind, or I'll lose mine.

Little Rock,Collin Raye,Country,"Well, I know I disappeared a time or two
And along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start

I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
Sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night

I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me

I don't know why I held it all inside
You must've thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
That Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me

Lying here upon this motel bed
My thoughts of you explode inside my head
Like a castle built upon the sand
I let love crumble in my hand

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock

I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me

Without you, baby I'm not me...

Here Comes That Rainbow Again,The Highwaymen,Country,"The scene was a small roadside cafe.
The waitress was sweepin' the floor.
Two truck drivers drinkin' their coffee,
And two Okie kids by the door.

""How much are them candies?"" they asked her.
""How much have you got?"" she replied.
""We've only a penny between us.""
""Them's two for a penny,"" she lied.

And the daylight grew heavy with thunder,
With the smell of the rain on the wind.
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again.

One truck driver called to the waitress,
After the kids went outside.
""Them candies ain't two for a penny,""
""So what's it to you?"" she replied.

In silence they finished their coffee.
Got up and nodded goodbye.
She called,""Hey, you left too much money.""
""So what's it to you?"" they replied.

And the daylight was heavy with thunder,
With the smell of the rain on the wind.
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again.
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again."
If I Were You,Collin Raye,Country,"You want to know where we go from here.
So many roads, but none that seem clear.
Is what we have enough to last a whole life through?
Who knows? Baby, who knows?

So you're asking me 'what do we do'?
'Cause time moves so fast, and the chances seem so few.
Is it too much to think that we could have it all?
Who knows? We May never know.

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all it's worth.
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth.
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need.
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me.

So hold me close, I'll kiss away your fears.
I won't promise the moon, but I promise to be here.
And what if together it gets better everyday?
Who knows? Baby, who knows?

My Best Friend And Me,Clay Davidson,Country,"As I sit here watchin' the sun come up
Through the back window of my pickup truck
I recall how it used to be
Cruisin' the town all night long
With a couple of beers and a radio song
My best friend and me
Just my best friend and me
My best friend to me was more like a brother
I'd run around with him more than any other
Where you saw one you saw the other
Just a sittin' around or runnin' for cover
That's the way that it used to be
With my best friend and me

Well there never was much goin' on
But it beats the hell out of staying home
Mama said you're headin' for trouble boy you wait and see
We would go in spite of hell or high water
Never had a worry, never had a dollar
My best friend and me
Oh, Just my best friend and me."
10 Miles To Go On A 9 Mile Road,Jim White,Country,"They tell me miracles abound now more than ever, but I don't care. They say it's better to be blessed than it is to be clever, but I don't care. 'Cause I got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road, and it's a rocky rough road, but I don't care. For life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer, you keep your head held high, a'walking and a'talking till the power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you... you... You don't get nothing for free, 'less of course you steal it, at least that's what the people say. The sad irony of Love is how so seldom you feel it, yet it's all you dream about, night and day. From the splinter in the hand, to the thorn in the heart, to the shotgun to the head, you got no choice but to learn to glean solace from pain or you'll end up cynical or dead. Me, I got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road and it's a rocky rough road, but I don't care.
For life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer,
You keep your head held high, a'walking and a'talking and a'talking and a'walking, till the power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you... THERE!Sometimes you throw yourself into the sea of faith, and the sharks of doubt come and they devour you. Other times you throw yourself into the sea of faith only to find the treasure lost in the shipwreck inside of you! There ain't no guarantees, none of that nonsense like on TV, just gotta roll the dice, and take your lumps. You're gonna get yourself knocked down, so better learn to stand back up, for those who dwell on disaster let sorrow be their master. Me, I got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road and it's a rocky rough road, but I don't care. 'Cause life's nothing if not a blind rambling prayer, you keep your head held high, a'walking and a'talking till the power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there.
The power of Love deliver you there. The power of Love deliver you there. My buddy Phillip works as a gas station attendant. Strangers call his name to him a thousand times a day. They don't know him, they're just asking ""Phillip"" for a ""fill-up"". Funny how fate plays tricks on us... that way---through the power of Love."
Listenin' To The Radio,Chely Wright,Country,"He wears a Harley Jacket and a ""Kiss me smile.

Well, were listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.
Wind's goin' our way.
Sittin' right beside him.
Hell-bent, holdin' on.
Flippin' through the stations.
Lookin' for a fast song.
Singin' along with the ones we know.
Listenin' to the radio.


Well, we stop for gas, but not for long.
'Cause that Philco radio keeps us movin' along.
He floors that '66 Mustang, rag top 289.
While I blow him kisses from the passenger side.
'Cause it makes him crazy.
It drives him wild.
He likes his lovin' country style

I slide on over when the song slows down.
I give him all my love to throw his arms around.
We're so in love we never touch the ground.
Blastin' through the wind in a wall of sound.

Best Of Intentions (2006 Remastered LP Version),Travis Tritt,Country,"Capo 1st

I had big plans for our future,
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise,
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle,
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser,
'Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner,
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember,
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do

To show my love for you.

Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of_ intentions

Like I Never Loved Before,Phil Vassar,Country,"I guess I gave myself to someone
Maybe a time or two
Well I tried, I went through the motions
What was I supposed to do
Well I spun my wheels, I wasted so much time
And then with you I finally got it right

It's like I never loved before
Like I never saw the sun
Or felt the rain fall on my face
It's like, like it's never ever been
Can't imagine life without you anymore
It feels just like I never loved before

I never talked about forever
Now it's not long enough
Well who's that guy looking in the mirror
'Cause it's not the man I was
I only know I tremble when we kiss
I'm making up for everything I missed

It's like I never loved before
Like I never saw the sun
Or felt the rain fall on my face
It's like, like it's never ever been
I can't imagine life without you anymore
It feels just like I never loved before

I ran around in circles
I never knew
I was only getting ready for you

It's like, like I never loved before
Like I never saw the sun
Or felt the rain fall on my face
It's like, like it's never ever been
I can't imagine life without you anymore
It feels just like I never loved before."
The Road Goes On Forever,The Highwaymen,Country,"Kristofferson:
Sherry was a waitress,
At the only joint in town.
She had a reputation,
As a girl who'd been around.
Down Main Street after midnight,
With a brand new pack of cigs.
A fresh one hanging from her lips,
A beer between her legs.
She'd ride down to the river,
And meet with all her friends.
All 4:
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends

Nelson:
Sonny was a loner,
Bolder than the rest.
He was goin' in the Navy,
But he couldn't pass the test.
So he hung around town,
And he sold a little pot.
The law got wind of Sonny,
And one day he got caught.
But he was back in business,
When they set him free again.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.

Jennings:
Sonny's playin' eight ball,
At the joint where Sherry works.
Some drunken out-of-towner,
Put his hand up Sherry's skirt.
Sonny took his pool cue,
Laid the drunk out on the floor.
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar,
Walked out of the door.
She's runnin' right behind him,
Reachin' for his hand.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.

Cash:
They jumped into his pick-up,
Sonny jammed her down in gear.
Sonny looked at Sherry,
Said, ""Let's get on out of here.""
The stars were high above them.
The moon was in the east.
The sun was setting on them,
When they reached Miami Beach.
They got a motel by the water,
And a quart of Bombay Gin.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.

Kristofferson:
They soon ran out of money.
But Sonny knew a man.
Who knew some Cuban refugees,
Who dealt in contraband.
Sonny met the Cuban,
In a house just off the route.
With a briefcase full of money,
And a pistol in his boot.
The cards were on the table,
When the law came bustin' in.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.

Nelson:
The Cubans grabbed the goodies,
Sonny grabbed the jack.
He broke the bathroom window,
And climbed on out the back.
Sherry drove the pick-up,
Through the alley on the side.
Where the lawman tackled Sonny,
And was reading him his rights.
She stepped out in the alley,
With a single-shot four-ten.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.

Jennings:
They left the lawman dyin',
And they made their get away.
Got back to the motel,
Just before the break of day.
Sonny gave her all the money,
And he blew a little kiss.
If they ask you how this happened,
Say I forced you into this.
She watched him as his tail lights,
Disappeared around the bend.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.

Cash:
There's a main street after midnight.
Just like it was before.
Twenty-one months later,
At the local grocery store,
Sherry buys a paper,
And a cold six-pack of beer.
The headlines read that Sonny,
Is going to the chair.
She pulls back onto main street,
In her new Mercedes-Benz.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends."
The Sad Milkman,The Handsome Family,Country,"Above the dark highway, on a black tar roof
Stood the sad milkman in love with the moon
She filled up his window with soft milky light
So he climbed up the chimney and into the night

But the moon, she rises
And the moon, she falls
And her slow white eye
Sees nothing at all

Down on the sidewalk, a crowd gathered 'round
Throwing up bricks and bottles to knock the boy down
He stood up above them with his hands in the air
Crying up to the moonbeams, come let down your hair

But the moon, she rises
And the moon, she falls
And her slow white eye
Sees nothing at all

He wanted to feel like a bucket of milk
Or sweet summer wind on rolling green hills
He wanted to fly up from the roof
Up through the night wind to the arms of the moon

But the moon, she rises
And the moon, she falls
And her slow white eye
Sees nothing at all

But the moon, she rises
And the moon, she falls
And her slow white eye
Sees nothing at all"
Skateland South,Cory Branan,Country,"Every other Sunday at the skateland south

Hell I mights as well undo my laces because there she is

All marshmallow-white and bubblegum-pink
Her dreamsicle roller-skates circle the rink
And this pastel heaven can last until seven or eight
If my mom watches Falcon Crest
Sometimes she picks me up late

Hey D.J. play the one I know you know
As I roll across the carpet smooth and slow
Ease the neon nice and low
The next one ins couple skate only

My friends bet their quarters that I'm gonna cave
But this seventh soda pop's making me brave
Or maybe it's the black light
But the moment looks right to me
So I roll up like romeo, juliet say can you see

That video game - that's Galaxia 4
One day I'll get the highest score
And I'll type in your name
I wanna share all this fame with you
And we'll celebrate with a couple skate, or two

Hey D.J. play the one I know you know ...

... Celebrate good times - c'mon"
If Shania Was Mine,Cledus T. Judd,Country,"This is what Cledus T. wants...

If Shania was mine
Wouldn't be proud of me
Couldn't hardly blame her
'Cause I'm so derned ugly
But on our first date
We could have a good time
If I got her on the moonshine

If Shania was mine
Say it fit just right
Though my polyester suit was just a little too tight
And there's no way
I'd have a bad hair day
'Cause I'd buy a new toupee'

Oh, I'd love to seduce her
But she married her producer
Now all I do is pray, pray, pray!
She'll get a deevorce someday

If Shania was mine
I'd probably lose my mind
If she only squeezed me, teased me
Pleased me one good time
And if she only knew
All the things I'd do
I'd be the lawn mowin, crop growin'
Tater peelin, house cleanin kind
If Shania was mine

Ha huh

If Shania was mine
She'd have to agree
Can't no one cook road kill better than me
Add a dozen mountain oysters and some old fatback
She'd say ""Mmm, I like it like that"" cha...
Now all I do is wonder
Whose bed have her boots been under
I wish she'd hadda been mine
Now I whine, whine!
That girl is so doggone fine

If Shania was mine
I think I'd go slap blind
Starin' at her yummy little tummy
And her booty shakin' round behind
And if she only knew
All the things I'd do
I'd be the lawn mowin' crop growin'
Tater peelin' house cleanin' kind
If Shania, if Shania, if Shania,
If Shania, if Shania (ACK HACK)

Now was that Mutt Lange or Deewight Yokel

When she shimmies and shakes
It's more than I can take
Oh, what she does to me in them videos
Wife's gonna leave me if I don't explain
What I see in Shania Twain
I'd love to see her in a magazine
Centerfold if you know what I mean
Oh me-a oh my-a
I wish that Shania
Would buy me a house in South Carolina
Two, four, six, eight, nine
Oh I wish that Shania was mine!
He he he huh huh
Want to be a gal of mine..."
Water & Bridges,Kenny Rogers,Country,"I was young, so was she.
Life didn't stay a mystery for very long...
We could do no wrong.
Then she called, said she was late.
So we took a little drive upstate antook care of that...
Yeah, just took care of that.

But now I'm longinback at some of my decisions,
Now that it's much too late to change...
How a father could have held his son.
If I could undo what's been done,
But I guess everyone is living,
With water and bridges.

Now my old man, he had it rough,
'Cause like his Daddy, when he drank too much,
He'd get mean, antake it out on me.
So with angry words, I was gone.
I never even tried to go back home, the night he died.
Momma said he apologized.

Now I'm longinback on some of my decisions,
Now that it's much too late to change...
How a father could have held his son.
If I could undo what's been done,
But I guess everyone is living,
With water and bridges.

We could all go crazy from,
Things that only time can dull.
I guess that's why everyone is given,
Water and bridges.
Water and bridges.
Water and bridges."
Small Stuff,Alabama,Country,"There's a little cafe' on the corner of town
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down
It ain't very much but she brings home
The bacon and the bread
We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on
But it seems like all of our money is gone
Before we get a chance to get ahead
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff

Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age
Small stuff
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff
So we don't sweat the small stuff

There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night
Had to drive it home with one taillight
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff

Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age
Small stuff
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff
So we don't sweat the small stuff

Drivin' Nails In My Coffin,Ernest Tubb,Country,"My sweetheart has gone and I'm so lonely
She said that she and I were through

As Long As You're Looking Back,Gary Allan,Country,"Got your feet wet, got your heart broke
Didn't pan out like you'd hoped
But you played fair and you swear that
Love had the damn deck stacked

And you just won't put it behind you
But you sit and you dwell on the past
Well, can't you see, you can't see tomorrow
As long as you're looking back

You had someone you could count on
You believed in bet your life on
But your back turned and the knife fell
You swear that payback is gonna be hell

Now you just can't trust anybody
'Cause that friend was just a snake in the grass
Boy, can't you see, you can't see tomorrow
As long as you're looking back

You can't move on
'Til you let go
Of what's gone

No, you're never gonna trust anybody
If you sit here and you dwell on the past
Fool can't you see, you can't see tomorrow
As long as you're looking back

Got your feet wet, got your heart broke
Didn't pan out like you'd hoped"
Let That Pony Run,Pam Tillis,Country,"Mary was married with children,
Had the perfect suburban life,
Till her husband came clean with the help of Jim Beam
And confessed all his sins one night.
Said he'd fallen in love with a barmaid,
Said she made him feel reckless and young.
And when he got through, what else could she do?
She just let that pony run.

'Cause you do what you gotta do,
And you know what you know.
You hang on till you can't hang on,
Then you learn to let go.
You get what you want sometimes,
But when it's all said and done,
You do what you gotta do
Then you let that pony run.

Now Mary moved to West Virginia,
After the shock wore off.
She got a divorce and a chestnut horse
And a barn with an old hayloft.
Sometimes she rides down by the river,
Said it makes her feel reckless and young.
She just closes her eyes, and she holds on tight,
And she lets that pony run.

'Cause you do what you gotta do,
And you know what you know.
You hang on till you can't hang on,
Then you learn to let go.
You get what you want sometimes,
But when it's all said and done,
You do what you gotta do
Then you let that pony run."
Threadbare Gypsy Soul,Pat Green,Country,"Got myself a threadbare gypsy soul
Likes to dance and drink and go wherever the wind blows
Gotta little threadbare gypsy soul
Gotta little threadbare gypsy soul

Gotta little wild streak in my heart
I guess that I have had it since I heard the music start
I gotta little wild streak in my heart
I gotta little threadbare gypsy soul

I like to hear the highway sounds
And I don't think that I'll ever settle down
I can't change and it's a sin
Hope St. Peter gonna let me in
Come on Pete won't you let me in

I wear this cowboy hat up on my head
And you can take it off me some time after I am dead
Gotta cowboy hat up on my head
Gotta a little threadbare gypsy soul

I wear these crusty shoes down on my feet
I could write a book about the places that they've seen
I got these crusty shoes down on my feet
I gotta little wild streak in my heart

And I like to hear the highway sounds
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever settle down
And I can't change and it's a sin
I hope St. Peter gonna let me in
Come on Pete won't you let me in

I know this crazy living just ain't right
Most of the time I'm smoking, drinking, looking for a fight
But I've been talking to Jesus every day
I've been talking to Jesus every day

And I got this girl back home I call my wife
If you ever met her I swear she would change your life
She's gotta little wild streak in her heart
But she's been saying hallelujah every day

I like to hear the highway sounds
I don't think that I'll ever settle down
I can't change and it might be a sin
Hope St. Peter gonna let me in
Got my gypsy soul to bare, Amen"
Should've Been A Cowboy,Toby Keith,Country,"I'll bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillon say
""Miss Kitty have you ever thought of runnin' away?
Or settlin' down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?""

She'd of said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss, as he rode away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
Stealin' the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those camp fire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I might have had a side-kick with a funny name
Runnin' wild through the hills chasin' Jesse James
Or ending up on the brink of danger
Ridin' shot-gun for the Texas rangers

Go west young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleepin' all night, beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
Stealin' the young girl's hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those camp fire songs

Miller's Cave,Hank Snow,Country,"(Dark old cave Miller's Cave)
Way down in the state of Georgia through the swamps and everglades

Made me feel I was unwanted like the birds and the bears in Miller's Cave
(Miller's Miller's Miller's Miller's Cave)

I couldn't stand the way she did me couldn't take her lowdown ways
Before I'll stay with the cheating woman I'll go live with the bears in Miller's Cave
I caught her out one Sunday morning with the man they call Big Dave
Meanest man in way cross Georgia I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave

I said you'll pay both you and Davy I must see you in your graves
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
I took their cheatin' skin and bones in Miller's Cave

Most wanted man in the state of Georgia
But they'll never find me 'cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave

Good Hearted Woman,Willie Nelson,Country,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just felt by the way
And the good life he promised
Is not what she's living to day
But she never complains of
The bad times or bad things he's done
She's just talks about the good times
They've had and all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass though his world hand in hand

In love with her good timin' man

Now he likes the night life
The brightlights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over
She welcome him back home again
Though she don't understand him
She does the best that she can

In love with her good timin' man

The King of Oak Street,Kenny Rogers,Country,"Like a leaf caught in the wind he drifted a while

And forget about the things he left behind.

The cryin' woman standing helpless in his door
With a two month old baby in her arms
His little black book laying torn up on the floor
And God only knows he never meant to do her wrong.

A careless weekend on the other side of town
Has torn the king of Oak Street's Castle down
And all week long he's tried to call her but she won't let him explain
Now Sunday morning finds him walking in the rain.

He sits down in a phone booth and he prays
That she'll forgive him and she'll believe he's changed his ways
With shaking hand he deposits his last dime
And he's still praying that she won't hang up this time.

Then the sweetest voice he's ever heard says hello
Breakfast's almost ready baby, come on home

That the king of Oak Street is just an ordinary man.

Coward Of The County,Kenny Rogers,Country,"Evryone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

Everyone considered him the coward of the county"

It twists and it shakes you before it turns you upside down
You can't see what's around the corner
And You can't look back, so just live it up and feel the rush

Where Do The Nights Go,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"Without you in my life every night seemed like a lifetime.

The clock on the wall never seemed to move at all
Or was it just my mind.
Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast.

Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like?Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?

If I had a time machine, I'd make the daylight seem like fleeting moments
And every single night would be exactly like the night that we spent
But it won't be long until I'm alone with my desire
'Cause the stars are going out and my heart is still on fire,
Tell me where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, where do the nights,
Where do the nights go?

Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like? Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?

Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast, tell me.

Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like?Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?

Hard Livin',Keith Whitley,Country,"Well you can call out the sheriff and the highway patrol

Well I keep my motor runnin' got my beer on the ice
And my idea of heaven is a pair of dice
Seven come on eight set this poor boy free
Lord I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me

Bright lights Saturday night I had a couple and I'm feeling alright
My cupcake she can wiggle and shake spend more money than anybody make

So give me a shot of that octane juice
You know where ain't no cure for the honky tonk blues
And if they come up with somethin' I'll develop an immunity
And I wish hard livin' didn't come easy for me

Out on the town just a foolin' around
Hey I got my mind on the lost and found
Step up no need to be shy
All right pretty women you got the ticket to ride

When my tires are flat and I'm out of gas
I promise myself I'll let the next one pass

The Love Between A Woman And A Man,Chris Cagle,Country,"Way back home where the cyprass grew
In a clapboard shack on the black bayou
Lived a women and a man that I called mom and dad
And times were hard and times were tough
We barely had nothin' but we didn't need much
Except for the love a women and a man
And daddy worked his fingers to the bone
But I know my momma was the reason he was strong

Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds don't sprout and the crops wont grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when you're livin' in a house that you don't own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a women and a man

Well I grew up workin like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand, no
You see the only thing that matters that money can't buy
And when it gets right down to the bottom line
It's the love you find between a women and a man

Everything daddy said was true
Cause my life was not complete until I found you

Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds don't sprout and the crops wont grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when you're livin' in a house that you don't own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a women and a man

Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds don't sprout and the crops wont grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when you're livin' in a house that you don't own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a women and a man

Only thing in life that stands
Is the love between a women and a man"
(There's) No Gettin' Over Me,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"Well, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me.

Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no.

Don't you know you can tell everyone that we're through
You might even believe it too
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down
So you can walk out on me tonight.

If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
You'll see sweet darling, there's ain't no getting over me
No, no, no, no, No Darling, there ain't no getting over me.

Ooh mmmm
Mmmm No darling, there ain't no getting over me.

Ooh darling, there ain't no getting over me..."
Getting Ready,Miranda Lambert,Country,"Oh baby, I'm gettin' ready
I'm gettin' ready to let you go
My hands are shakin' my hearts unscathed
Oh how I was a lucky soul

I know all the magic's gone
Wish I had a magic wand
I would put a spell on you
You would see it as I do

Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh
I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh wo oh wo wo oh wo oh
I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh baby you're my ??
I was just your cigarette
I was nothing you could be proud of
I have lost my self respect


My self respect, self respect
I have lost my self respect
Oh wo oh wo wo oh wo oh
I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh wo oh wo wo oh wo oh
I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh baby, baby I got no traction
I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for your reaction
So I tried a new direction
I'm gonna get my self a resurrection
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,
I'm getting ready to let you go
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,
I'm getting ready to let you go

Let you go"
It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,Kitty Wells,Country,"As I sit here tonight the jukebox's playing
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are saying
It brings mem'ries when I was a trustin' wife

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong

It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

It wasn't God who made..."
Sunday In The South,Shenandoah,Country,"Mill worker houses lined up in a row,
Another southern Sunday morning blow
Beneath the steeple all the people have begun
Shakin' hands with the man who grips the gospel gun
While the quiet prayer, the smell of dinner on the ground
Heals up the morning air, ain't nothin' sweeter around

I can almost hear my mama pray:
""Oh lord forgive us when we doubt,""
Another sacred Sunday in the south

A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all
Popping in the wind like an angry cannon ball
The holes of history are cold and still,
But they smell the powder burnin' and they probably always will

And on the old town square under the barber shop pole,
They sat me up in the chair when I was four years old

I can almost hear my papa say:
""Won't you hold still son, stop squirmn' around
Another sacred sundays coming down""

I can almost hear the old folks say:
""You'll make it big one day, you'll leave this town,""
Some other lazy Sunday you'll come back around

I can feel the evening sun go down,
And all the lights in the houses one by one go out
Softly in the distance nothing stirs about
And the night is filled with the sound of a whipporwil

On a Sunday in the south"
The Way It Is,Laura Cantrell,Country,"It was a beautiful idea when it started,
It hit so hard, I never thought it through.
Leaving the west side of town,
Way on up riverside rushing down,
That's the freest moment a city girl knew.

I've got the beauty of the moment,
Passed so quickly,
Now the tingle and the chill got me confused.
So as I buckle down, why knuckle you 'round.
Those free moments feel so fare and few.

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
An I can't help myself at all
That's just the way it is

I see you crossing the street,
Come and meet me.
Like an image come to mind too long ago.
Well there's a smile across your mouth
Those eyes are looking south.
If I could see them what would they let me know?

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
An I can't help myself at all
That's just the way it is

I looked and found them lost and started
I've sown and reeded and plowed the ground once more
I laid my hammer down, wandered this city all around
Ended up on the streets I walked before

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
An I can't help myself at all
That's just the way it is

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
An I can't help myself at all
That's just the way it is"
When We All Get To Heaven,Alan Jackson,Country,"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;
Sing his mercy and his grace.
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory!

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon his beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open;
We shall tread the streets of gold.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory!"
Silver Eagle,Merle Haggard & George Jones,Country,"Well, he rides into town on the back of a big silver eagle
Strapped to his shoulders are the burden of staying on top
And the lines in his face tell the story of an uphill flight
You can tell how he feels day by day by the songs that he writes

He's loved by millions, somehow he's their prisoner as well
As he rides down the road in his ten-wheel aluminum cell
Now he lives for the day that the eagle will carry him home
'Cause the glamor is over nearly all of his seeds have been flown

Letting go silver eagle, there must be a better way of life
For this great American poet who's singing his songs about
The everyday working man's life

One night on the road just south of the Idaho line
We were smoking some contracts and attempting to alter our minds
Then just before daylight Hag pushed back his hat and he said
""I wouldn't put in too much emphasis on being a star
Can we do a little bit of living instead?""

Letting go silver eagle, there must be a better way of life
For this great American poet who's singing his songs about
The everyday working man's life
Letting go silver eagle, there must be a better way of life

House down the block,Buck Owens,Country,"The house my family lives in just down the block
Many times I passed there but I never stopped
I go on all alone a wishin' I could be
In that house down the block with my family

When we meet upon the street I just bow my head
They don't know how often I wish that I was dead
To our name I brought the shame but still I long to be
In that house down the block with my family

When Gabriel blows his trumpet and time will be no more
When mem'ries fade, my daddy's faith I'll walk up to the door
The tears that fall won't start at all and God will let me be
In that house down the block with my family..."

I Love You A Thousand Ways,Lefty Frizzell,Country,"I love you, I'll prove it in days to come
I swear it's true, darlin', you're the only one
I think of you, of the past and all our fun
I love you, I'll prove it in days to come

You're my darling, you've been true
I should have been good to you
You're the one that's in my heart
While we're apart

I'll be true, I'll prove it to you someday
I love you, in my heart you'll always stay
I've been so blue and lonesome all these days
I love you, I'll prove it a thousand ways

I'll be nice and sweet to you
And no more will you be blue
I'll prove I love you every day
All kinds of ways

There'll be a change, a great change made in me
I'll be true, there'll never be blue days
I love you, I'll prove it a thousand ways"
I Believe In You,Don Williams,Country,"I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And bein' first is always best.

But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you.

Well, I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I'd like to think of God as love
He's down below
He's up above
He's watchin' people everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am.

But I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you.

I know with all my certainty
What's goin' on with you and me
Is a good thing
It's true
I believe in you.

I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used be
In workin' days and sleepin' nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robinhood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The risin' cost of gettin' by

But I believe in love
I believe in old folks
I believe in children
I believe in you.

I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you."
I Want To Live,John Denver,Country,"There are children raised in sorrow
On a scorched and barren plain
There are children raised beneath the golden sun
There are children of the water
And children of the sand
And they cry out through the universe
Their voices raised as one

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live

Have you gazed out on the ocean
Seen the breaching of a whale?
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live

For the worker and the warrior the lover and the liar
For the native and the wanderer in kind
For the maker and the user and the mother and her son
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine

We are standing all together
Face to face and arm in arm
We are standing on the threshold of a dream
No more hunger no more killing
No more wasting life away
It is simply an idea
And I know its time has come

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live"
Memory Of Me,Holly Williams,Country,"(Holly Williams)

Love no more, I have got a prayer
I ask forgiveness everywhere
Devil unseen, please stop bothering me
I've got a broken man to repair

Brakes aren't working now
I'm trying to stop this train
Of desperation, loneliness and pain

Nothing's up ahead, the lights are supposed to be there
And you probably think I never cared
I hope to God one day you find some peace
With the memory of me

Now it's all in your head, and I'm the one at fault
Maybe I never loved you at all
I'd like to say I did, but I just don't know how
My heart could do the damage I allowed
The victim of my youth, the soldier of my dread
And I left all those tears in your bed
I hope to God one day you'll find some peace
With the memory me

My potential is improving, my reckless days more calm
I know you won't believe me when I'm singing you this song
Damn I wanted to please you, I just didn't have the will
I was never looking for someone to keep me still...
Now I see

So if you pass this way again, if you feel the need
I'd love to hear the words that wait for me
But you don't need my sympathy, you're stronger than I think"

Oh Romeo,Mindy McCready,Country,"(Matraca Berg/Gary Harrison)

Juliet waits at the border
Of a creek without a corner
Gazes into the dark
Was it the moon or only
Her fear of being lonely
That gave her leave of her heart?
Oh- oh-oh

Oh Romeo (Romeo)
Who would lay down her life? (Romeo)
Swallow the poison, pick up the knife
Maybe I cried (maybe I cried)
Just a teardrop or two (tear or two)
I would not die for you
I would not die for you

Just another romantic depressant
Giving in she becomes obsessive
Maybe this time I'll learn
Life's like a box of matches
Sometimes the whole thing catches
And all you can do is watch it burn
Oh-oh-oh

Oh Romeo (Romeo)
Who would lay down her life? (Romeo)
Swallow the poison, beck of the night
Maybe I cried (maybe I cried)
Just a teardrop or two (tear or two)
I would not die for you
I would not die for you

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Juliet waits at the border
Contemplates the new world order

Oh Romeo (Romeo)
Who would lay down her life? (Romeo)
Swallow the poison, beck of the night
Maybe I cried (maybe I cried)
Just a teardrop or two (tear or two)
I would not die for you
I would not die for you

Tennessee Flat Top Box,Rosanne Cash,Country,"In a little cabaret
In a south Texas border town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from all around
And all the girls
From there to Austin
Were slippin' away from home
And puttin' jewelry and hopped to take the trip
To go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make it down
But give him his guitar
And he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls
From nine to ninety
Were snappin' fingers
Tappin' toes
And beggin' him don't stop
And hypnotized
And fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Then one day he was gone
And no one ever saw him 'round
He vanished like the breeze
They forgot him in the little town
But all the girls
Still dreamed about him
And hung around
The cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day
On the hit parade
Was the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play"
The Rhumba Boogie,Hank Snow,Country,"Well come all you children give a listen to me
Let me tell you 'bout a new boogie beat
There's no hesitation and it's sweepin' the nation
It's the Rhumba Boogie down the South American way

While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga
In her little cabana in old Havana
We were doing the Charleston and Ballin' the Jack
Then that Old Black Bottom till they started the Jitterbug Rag

Then across the water came Cuban Pete
He started the boogie to the rhumba Beat
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's give it a whirl
While he plays the Boogie in the South American style

Break (guitar)

Well you step out together then you circle around
Count one two three then put your right foot down
Then you circle your lady as you swing and you sway
To the Rhumba Boogie in the South American way

When that old piano it starts to ring
Everybody then starts to sing
To the Rhumba Boogie done the tropical style
It's the Rhumba Boogie and they're doin' it all of the while

Well the guy responsible for leadin' the band
He yells do your stuff it's the best in the land
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's dance it a while
To the boogie woogie done the Rhumba Cuban all style

Break (guitar)

While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga
In her little cabana in old Havana
The folks in old Mexico where doin' the tango
And we were steppin' to the rhythm of an old guitar

He started to boogie to the rhumba beat

Blowin' In The Wind,Bobby Darin,Country,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before he sleeps in the sand?
And how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years can mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
And how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
And how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
And how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it takes till he knows
That too many people have died?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
Born A Woman,Sandy Posey,Country,"It makes no difference
If you're rich or poor
Or if you're smart or dumb
A woman's place in this old world
Is under some man's thumb

And if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
You're born to be stepped on
Lied to, cheated on
And treated like dirt

Ah, if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
A woman's lot is to give and give
And go on giving
A woman's got to love and lose
And go on living

Well, I was born a woman
I didn't have no say
And when my man finally comes home
He makes me glad it happened that way
Because to be his woman
No price is too great to pay

Yes, I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way
Oh, I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way"
Lay Me Down (Album Version),The Wreckers,Country,"You let me in
'Cause after all
It seemed like the right thing to do

I closed my eyes
And let you fall
I wonder what you could possibly know
About breaking down that I don't

It's been awhile
Since I begged for
Anything but now I want more

So lay me down
I'm lonely
You don't understand me
And you'd never even try to 
Anyway

I hear you say
It's not the same
I'm sorry
It's something I just can't explain

So shut your mouth
And hold me close
We both know
It's better than being alone

I don't mind
Killing time
As long as I can't see it in your eyes

If wanting you's so wrong then I'm wrong
I'll admit it
Time after time you'll realize
You don't mean it"
Tramps and Hawkers,Dave Alvin,Country,"1. I choose not to see the things that be,
Or the miles and years that are gone.
I pay no heed to tomorrow's need,
I'm blinded by the snow and the sun,
Till all I could see is my darlin' and me,
Like young flowers bloomin' in spring.
Like flowers that grew, and no other I knew,
But the Rose of the San Joaquin.

2. The gypsies would dance, while stealing a glance
As leaves might blow in the wind.
And the fields are worked in a sweat stained shirt,
Then the workers all move on again.
And the tramps and hawkers, with stories wild,
Beguiled a young boy's dreams,
Enticing me to leave my home,
And the Rose of the San Joaquin.

3. I've watched the rise of light in the sky
When the sun climbs out of the sea.
Seen giants fall in mountains tall,
Where the lumbermen cut down the trees.
I've played in the sand with the gulf coast wind,


Fell asleep in the grass tall and green.
But nowhere I've been would I go back again,
Compared to the San Joaquin.

4. Well the road back home is hard and it's long,
And the miles, they turn into years.
And the tramps and hawkers in every town,
By God, but it brings me to tears.
When I got home, I found just a flower on the mound
Where it shamed the green grasses of spring.
It grew from the grave of my darlin' little girl,
The Rose of the San Joaquin.

5. Oh see us today out on the highway,
Or asleep in the doors of the train.
See the gypsies dance with their damned old glances,
Hear the peddlers cry out their refrain.
And who's gonna care, and who's gonna share
All the joys, the sorrows we've seen?
Like ghosts, we roam, without friends or home,
These tramps, and hawkers and me.
Like ghosts, we roam, without friends or home,
These tramps, and hawkers and me."
Dream River,The Mavericks,Country,"(Raul Malo, Evan York)

Floating down the dream river,
With the moon and stars above,
Maybe they can help me find a way
To have your whole love

Sleeping in the darkest room
Dreaming you are in my arms
Oh how I wish my dream comes true
With all my heart

Don't want this night to end
Don't want to live without you

Floating down the dream river
With you by my side
I know it's make-believe
But please don't wake me
I don't mind

Don't want this night to end
Don't want to live without you

Floating down the dream river

I know it's make-believe
But please don't wake me
I don't mind
I know it's make-believe
But please don't wake me
I don't mind."
I Won't Die Alone,Shelby Lynne,Country,"Ramble with an overtone
This queen lives without a drone
Searching lights they lead me home
I won't die alone.

Gamble with your old wife's money
You might need to call her honey
Nights are black and days are sunny
I won't die alone.

Hot white cake and ice cold coffee
Get this creepy monkey off me
Stomp and rant but do it softly
I won't die alone.

Wait and watch and paint and powder
Turn the noise up make it louder
I can't leave here as a coward
I won't die alone.

Wipe your head and be not sweaty
This room feels a little heavy
I ain't worried I am ready
I won't die alone.

It's raining on my love parade
Look at what a mess I made
It's all a joke a big charade
I won't die alone.

This is easy this is gravy
I feel like a little baby
This feels like a natural fade
I won't die alone
I won't die alone."
16th Avenue,Lacy J. Dalton,Country,"From the corners of the country
From the cities and the farms
With years and years of living
Tucked up underneath their arms

They walked away from everything
Just to see a dream come true
So god bless the boys who make the noise
On 16th Avenue

With a million dollar spirit
And an old flattop guitar
They drive to town with all they own
In a hundred dollar car

'Cause one time someone told them
About a friend of a friend they knew
Who owns you know a studio
On 16th Avenue

Now some were born to money
They've never had to say, ""Survive""
And others swing a 9 pound hammer
Just to stay alive

There's cowboys drunks and Christians
Mostly white and black and blue
They've all dialed the phone collect to home
From 16th Avenue

Ah, but one night in some empty room
Where no curtains ever hung
Like a miracle some golden words
Rolled off of someone's tongue

And after years of being nothing
They're all looking right at you
And for a while they'll go in style
On 16th Avenue

It looked so uneventful
So quiet and discreet
But a lot of lives where changed
Down in that little one way street

'Cause they walk away from everything
Just to see a dream come true
So God bless the boys who make the noise
On 16th Avenue

From the corners of the country
From the cities and the farms
With years and years of living
Tucked up underneath their arms

They walked away from everything
Just to see a dream come true
So God bless the boys who make the noise"
For the Good Times,Bobby Bare,Country,"Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning.

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time, for the good times.

I'll get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time, for the good times..."
Dream On Texas Ladies,John Michael Montgomery,Country,"Way down in Texas
Those cowgirls get restless
As they wait for that cowboy
Who will love them for life
And though they are certain
They'll meet him tomorrow
They're alone with their dreams for tonight

So dream on Texas ladies
About cowboys and babies
Hold out for that Lonestar
Who will love you for life
Dream on Texas ladies
About sunshine and daisies
Follow your heart
Where it leads you tonight

From Houston to Dallas
Those cowgirls sing ballads
About how love everlasting
Is love at its best
And they dream of that day
When they both ride away
As the sun slowly sets in the west

So dream on Texas ladies
About cowboys and babies
Hold out for that Lonestar
Who will love you for life
Dream on Texas ladies
About sunshine and daisies
Follow your heart
Where it leads you tonight

Dream on Texas ladies
About cowboys and babies
Hold out for that Lonestar
Who will love you for life
Dream on Texas ladies
About sunshine and daisies
Follow your heart
Where it leads you tonight

Dream on Texas ladies
About cowboys and babies
Hold out for that Lonestar
Who will love you for life
Dream on Texas ladies
About sunshine and daisies
Follow your heart

If You Knew,Neko Case,Country,"And if you knew what I know
You wouldn't go to see her
And least of all believe her when she says that she wants you
Well you're just another puppet, she's not even keeping score
And the lazy way she cheats you leaves me cold
She'll laugh about you, my best friend, but you don't know

'Cause if you knew what I know
You wouldn't go to see her
And least of all believe her when she says that she wants you

She spends her daddy's money
And she drives her daddy's car
And what's crazy is the way you think that's style
And all the while my heart is breaking
You're not even on her mind (?)

'Cause if you knew what I know
Babe you wouldn't leave me
You wouldn't turn away from my love it's what you said that you believed in

I say this as your friend
You'll be the poor boy in the end"
Just As I Am,Ricky Van Shelton,Country,"I was lost and aimlessly searching 
Lord knows, I was one lonely man 
Then you came along 
Like that old gospel song 
You took me just as I am 

Just as I was about to lose hope 
Just as I'd come to the end of my rope 
You turned me around with one touch of your hand 
And your love saved me just as I am 

It's amazing, you saw the light shining 
Though the darkness that life had left me in 
And I thank heaven above 
You took me just as I was 
And you loved me just as I am 

Just as I was about to lose hope 
Just as I'd come to the end of my rope 
You turned me around with one touch of your hand 
And your love saved me just as I am 
You turned me around with one touch of your hand 
And your love saved me just as I am"
Keg In The Closet,Kenny Chesney,Country,"We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on top of the car
He drank beer out of a mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed

A wide frame house in a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown
But we tried our best anyway

We went to class just to pass the time
Back in '89

We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

This old guitar taught me how to score
Right there on that Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more
About what one you can't have

Sweatshirts and flag football
Spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all
We never dreamed it wouldn't last

We went to class just to pass the time
Back in '89

We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

We all kind of went our separate ways
But I swear it seems like yesterday

Keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet"
If Wishes Were Horses,Claire Lynch,Country,"Well I was born with a dark cloud above me
A longing deep in my soul
I was raised up right and I know my momma loved me
But I begged her to let me go

I said, ""The grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'til I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride""

You know, I love you, my true companion
You've been my lifelong friend
But there's a hunger inside me
That I can't abandon 'til I see what's around the bend

You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'til I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride

Now I've been a rogue and I've been a rambler
I know too well my sins
I've got the faith of a saint but the soul of a gambler
And a heart like the restless wind

You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'til I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride
Yeah, if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride"
We Got The Love,Restless Heart,Country,"When the good Lord was handing out
The best things from above
We got the love
We got the love

I know we don't have a lot of money
We can barely keep the bills paid honey
But when we're in each other's arms
Who needs all that stuff
We got the love
We got the love

Don't need the finer things
Fancy cars or no diamond rings
I wanna roll down a simple road
Rock with you when we get old

Sometimes life's a desperate situation
Sometimes it's just grim determination
But I know we'll do what it takes
To make us tough enough

We got the love
We got the love

We got the love
We got the love

Don't need the finer things
Fancy cars or no diamond rings
I wanna roll down a simple road
Rock with you when we get old

Built this house of bricks and stone together
Trying to make it strong to last forever
But if these walls come tumblin' down
We still ain't givin' up

We got the love
We got the love

We got the love
We got the love

Roll down a simple road
Rock with you till we get old..."
I Said A Prayer,Pam Tillis,Country,"Under the sun, under the moon
Under the sky midnight blue
Under the maple, under the roof
I got down on my knees and told the truth

I told Him I was tired of feeling lonely
And I could really use my one and only

Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
And somehow it got through
Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
Now look at you
Wasn't God feelin' good that day

I heard you praying for
I got more, so much more

Just down the street, just down the road
Walking along, how could you have known
It must have been strange that little burning in your soul
Sorry 'bout the lightnin' bolt
But I told him I was tired of being lonely
And I could really use my one and only

Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
And somehow it got through
Oh, oh I said a prayer for you baby
Now look at you
Wasn't God feelin' good that day
I said a prayer for you ..."
I Miss Who I Was (With You),Patty Loveless,Country,"They say I seem different now
Hope I'm wiser any how
I've had some time to learn a thing or two
I know the change has done me good
But I don't feel like I wish I would
Sometimes I miss who I was with you

Every time your name comes up
I just smile don't say too much
A button's pushed, my heart gets stuck again
I pray it's just a passing thought
'Cause we both know we're better off
But sometimes I miss who I was with you

Stormy days and sleepless nights
Sometimes we even got it right
Can't believe what we put each other through
In spite of all our chemistry
Some things just aren't meant to be
Sometimes I miss who I was with you

Every time your name comes up
I just smile don't say too much
A button's pushed, my heart gets stuck again
I pray it's just a passing thought
'Cause we both know we're better off
But sometimes I miss who I was with you

Yeah, sometimes I miss who I was with you"

Caught In The Crossfire,Rhonda Vincent,Country,"In the month of June, five years ago
That's when I came to be,
And though I'm not yet wordly wise
My eyes can clearly see.
I love my mom and daddy too
I pray my soul to keep,
And I ask for a happy home
When I lay me down to sleep.

But lately mommy cries at night
She thinks that I won't hear,
When daddy said my name today
He wiped away a tear.
I know that something isn't right
I see it in their eyes,
Oh how I wish it wasn't so
But the truth can't be denied.

I'm caught in the crossfire
Of a war that can't be won,
Mom calls me her little man
Daddy's only son.
I love them both, but I can't choose
Which one to leave behind,
I'm caught in the crossfire
Of a world that's so unkind.

Before you go to sleep tonight
Say a prayer for me,
I'm one of the millions
From a broken family.
My wish is but a simple one
My needs they are but few,
The promise of a happy home
And love to see us through."
It Ain't Easy,Shooter Jennings,Country,"When I was just a young boy my daddy came to me
Said, ""Son out in this world there's a lotta things
That'll make you feel like your supposed to be
You don't have to read the good book
To be a good man just the same
And forget about the money
Money ain't brought nothing to your daddy but pain""

It ain't easy
It ain't easy
But you'll be alright

Now it's 15 years later now I'm out on the road
And it's been 4 years to day he died
And they won't even play us on the radio
And I think I've found my way alright
Without him here to catch me now and again
I just keep on moving along, keeping my mind on my song
And trying to figure out love

And it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But I'll be alright

Any other fool
Any other fool would throw this away
Any other fool, yeah

I wanna take a minute to thank you
For all the things that you done
Yeah, you gave me a light in the dark of the night
When there was no place to hide, no where to run

And it ain't easy
It ain't easy, is it baby?
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy

But we'll be alright, alright
Be alright, uh huh
Oh, it will be alright
It will be alright
Oh, it will be alright
It will be alright

The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea,The Louvin Brothers,Country,"""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down

I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down

""Bring my darling boy to me""
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late

Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in heaven, his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea

""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
I know that God in heaven looked down"
Sunday,Tift Merritt,Country,"I'm gonna have a good cry over nothin'
But a handful of cigarettes
I'm gonna leave the windows open
When I feel like gettin' dressed
I'm gonna think hard about leavin'
See if the afternoon can tell
I'm gonna let him lie there sleepin'
Then I'm gonna love him well

One mornin' gonna wake up
Far from this town where my body lies
But Sunday is nobody's business
Sunday is nobody's business
Tell all of the neighbors. Take back all your favors
And look away, Lord. Take down your eyes

The ice trays all are empty
There's nothin' here to eat at all
I can't even find a pack of matches
I left the oven on all night long
My mother's cross town I'm goin' to see her
My grandma's up there on the hill
She's drinkin' sherry with all of the angels
Savin' a little but until

That mornin' when I wake up
Far from this town where my body lies
But Sunday is nobody's business
Sunday is nobody's business
Tell all of the neighbors Take back all the favors
And look away Lord. Take down your eyes

I'm gonna spend it like I got it. Take it like I want it
Love like no one loves me at all
Cause in the place where I come from, you have to be careful
When everything is certain. When everything is fixed
When everything is fine. When everything is fine

I'm gonna buy some flowers at the grocery
With my last five dollars again
I don't care if lonely is comin'
I've been practicin'
Tonight in this window
The moon is gonna rise
If you wanna give me somethin', give me somethin'
Ah, but today don't give me no surprise
Don't give me no surprise"
The Revolution Starts Now,Steve Earle,Country,"I was walkin' down the street
In the town where I was born
I was movin' to a beat
That I'd never felt before
So I opened up my eyes
And I took a look around
I saw it written 'cross the sky
The revolution starts now
Yeah, the revolution starts now

The revolution starts now
When you rise above your fear
And tear the walls around you down
The revolution starts here
Where you work and where you play
Where you lay your money down
What you do and what you say
The revolution starts now
Yeah the revolution starts now

Yeah the revolution starts now
In your own backyard
In your own hometown
So what you doin' standin' around?
Just follow your heart
The revolution starts now

Last night I had a dream
That the world had turned around
And all our hopes had come to be
And the people gathered 'round
They all brought what they could bring
And nobody went without
And I learned a song to sing
The revolution starts now"
ROSE IN THE SAND,Gene Watson,Country,"Your beauty's like a rainbow that God made with his hands
Your love's the answer to the prayers of, once, a loveless man
Lady, you're a ray of hope on the darkest night
You were such a welcome sight to lost and lonely eyes

Like a rose in the sand
A lighthouse on the stormy sea reaching out a hand
You're a special lady to an ordinary man
Like a rose in the sand

Your satin skin is pleasing for calloused hands to touch
Your eyes do all the talkin' when the words don't say enough
And when the road is rocky and life is hard to bear
I make it through the longest day jusy knowin' you were there

Like a rose in the sand
A lighthouse on the stormy sea reaching out a hand
You're a special lady to an ordinary man
Like a rose in the sand

Like a rose in the sand
A lighthouse on the stormy sea reaching out a hand
You're a special lady to an ordinary man

Meant To Be,Sammy Kershaw,Country,"Well first I missed my plane
So I wound up on your flight
Then we got stuck in Dallas-Ft. Worth
Half the night

Call it fate
Destiny
Call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence
Circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh some things are meant to be

You said Atlanta was your home
Well I happened to live there too
I'd just broken up with someone and so had you
And when you said for everyone
There is someone they're meant to find
I knew I'd found mine

Call it fate

Turn Me To Love,Keith Whitley,Country,"I may not look like much
But I think that with your touch
I could be somebody you'd be proud of
Lend me a hand, understand
I've been such a lonely man
Help me find the hope that I've run out of
Turn me around, turn me on, turn me to love

Break these chains, that surround my heart

You can help me find a new direction
I need to live for a change get my world rearranged
I think you might be my love connection

Folsom Prison Blues,Johnny Cash,Country,"I hear the train a-comin', it's rollin' round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee snd smokin' big cigars
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
She's Leaving Me Because She Really Wants To,Lyle Lovett,Country,"Thank you my friend
I sincerely appreciate the words you say
About how she'll cry
And how she'll grieve and miss me
When she goes away

Say them again
I need to hear the words once more
I can't believe
How she'll miss me when she's gone
And how she'll want to come back home
And never leave

But she's leaving me
Because she really wants to
And she'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy
She'll be so very happy
She'll dance and sing
Or even learn to fly
And spend her time with anyone but me

What's that you say
That I'll get over her the more that time goes by
But time goes so slow
When all I have to do is sit around and cry

No she won't be back
I'd be a fool to try to fool myself that way
I know she hasn't one regret
Because she hasn't had one since
The day she came to stay

She's leaving me
Because she really wants to
And she'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy
She'll be so very happy
She'll dance and sing
And even learn to fly
And spend her time with anyone but me

She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone"
By The Time I Get To Phoenix,Glen Campbell,Country,"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall - that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go"
Yellow Roses,Hank Snow,Country,"I just received sweetheart your yellow roses
You tell me dear they mean that we're all through
You tell me that tonight your heart is broken

I'll place them near your photograph and as the petals fall
They'll hide from you my lonely tears that shouldn't fall at all
Then they will slowly fade away and die
But I'll still love you though yellow roses say goodbye
I'll place them near your photograph..."
That's All There Is,Lee Roy Parnell,Country,"Written by lee roy parnell and tony arata

More than a mountain of silver more than a river of pearls
Her love is more precious than anything in this world
Every time that I hold her it's like a diamond I've found
And when she whispers my name all my troubles go
Tumbling down

And that's all there is, child and there ain't no
More ain't nothing else here, child worth you troubling
For them with it are rich, babe them without it so poor
That's all there is my child there ain't no more
Summertime in the evening fireflies come out children
Lost in the feeling chasing them all around and round and
Round gentle hands that hold one ""daddy, quick come see""
And the look on her face is nothing less than amazing to me

Oh I've, I've come to understand I know now the lucky man
Ain't the one who has all that he wants but the one who
Wants all that he has

Oh, that's all there is child don't waste your time worrying,
Babe ain't worth the worry that's all"
I Like Drinking,The Gourds,Country,"I Like Drinking to forget your name

And I smoke reefer a'do much the same

Between me and you - there's ain't nothing I wouldn't do

To untangle these ties with you

How much sweet life source have you took

I keep thinking I'd rather not look

Our love's like a fern that's been dried up and burned

It's absurd - but I keep coming back.

Oh believe me bruther

I bleeve I'd ruther

Dig a hole and crawl in the ground

Between you and I I think I'd ruther die

So I'll just stay drunk all the time

I've been over and over this girl

But you like the rattle snakes curl

You coil to strike me again

In my wide world of sin

Lights out I think it's the end

Have mercy on me Jesus Christ"
She Keeps The Home Fires Burning,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"Crack of dawn I hit the road, set my shoulders for the heavy load
Coffee leaking through the paper sack
The foreman says I'm late again, he can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh, and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
And again

Out of gas, just my luck, four bald tires on my pickup truck
No more credit on my credit card
When I come home and hit that door
I remember what these aching arms are for
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
But she'll be burning in my mind

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

Homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world

Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain"
Love Can't Ever Get Better Than This,Ricky Skaggs,Country,"Lookin' at you I can see what I missed
Love can't ever get better than this
I never knew there was so much in a kiss
Love can't ever get better than this
I knew this ol' world like the back of my hand
I'd known a lot of boys but I never knew a man
You were somethin' darlin' I just couldn't resist
Oh love can't ever get better than this
Love can't ever get better than this
You took a country boy and gave his life a new twist
Love can't ever get better than this
I'm tellin' everyone you're at the top of my list
Love can't ever get better than this

Sticks,Craig Morgan,Country,"I was raised in the sticks,
That's where I get my kicks,
Tailgatin' with my buddies,
Boots and dog and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for my seat,
I Feel at home around a crowd of hicks

If you're on your feet before the sun comes up,
And out there in your trucks,
Makin' hay rain or shine,
Break a sweat before daylight
The kind that ain't afraid of work,
Elbow grease and good clean dirt,
Taste your whiskey made from corn,
But save your Sunday's for the Lord,
It's a good chance you were born and...

Raised in the sticks,
That's where you get my kicks,
Tailgatin' with their buddies,
Boots and dog and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for your seat,
You Feel at home around a crowd of hicks,
That were raised in the sticks

How 'bout them girls in baseball caps,
Ponytails pulled through the back,
T-shirts tied up in a knot,
Holy jeans and old flip flops,
But they know some fishing holes,
Sure cut down some old dirt roads,
How to lock and load a gun,
She shoots you straight believe me son,
I'm so glad I found me one

Raised in the sticks,
That's where they get my kicks,
Tailgatin' with their buddies,
Boots and dogs and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for their seat,
They Feel at home around a crowd of hicks,
That were raised in the sticks

Hillbilly Hell,Bellamy Brothers,Country,"Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly hell
The devil stepped right up and he said
""Well you look so countrified, leave your hat and boots outside
You won't need 'em, you're in hillbilly hell.

Well, they had a band without a steel guitar
And not one good ol' girl stood at the bar
No jukebox and no beer, am I the only redneck here
And the parkin' lot, was full of foreign cars.

Hillbilly hell, I'm not feelin' so well
Where did I go wrong
Was it somethin' in my song
That put me in this hillbilly hell.

I asked the devil just what did I do
To have to sweat it out down here with you
To me it don't seem fair, why can't I be up there
With the rest, Marty, Hank and Patsy too.

He said, ""You didn't write one good ol' gospel song
And not one little word about your mom
And you haven't yet, sang one single duet
With Willie Nelson and you know that's wrong.

Well, I woke up to a country station on my radio
Grabbed a pen and paper and the words began to flow
I wrote a song called God Bless Mom and ran out to the bus
Placed a call to Willie, Would you like to sing with us.

Hillbilly hell, I'm not feelin' so well
Where did I go wrong
Was it somethin' in my song
That put me in this hillbilly hell.

I dreamed I was in hillbilly hell..."
Just Another Day In Parodies,Cledus T. Judd,Country,"Writers screamin
Phones ringin'
My lawyer says that the mailman's bringing me a stack of cease and desist
Man I'm getting sick and tired of this
After my last album
My accountant
Said I owed about a hundred thousand
In legal bills retainer fees
Wish everybody'd stop suing me
Cause all I did was take a hit song
Swear I didn't know it
When I rewrote it
That I was doing anything wrong

Well if Phil Vassar's mad at me
Well it's just another day in parodies
Well there's no song that's safe from me
Well it makes sure, we'll see
But I won't get any royalties
Still I ask my label pretty please
Ooh ooh for just another day in parodies

I'm a big star
New cars
Never thought I'd take a joke this far
At the CMA's I sit beside
Garth Brooks and his ex-wife
But lately seems like
I catch hell for every song I write
Funny videos I've done a few
Making people laugh is all I wanna do
But last might I had a bad dream
CMT banned me
GAC canned me
They won't play no more comedy

Well lawsuits legalese
It's just another day in parodies
But there's nothing else I can really sing
I'll take one of Faith's Two of Tim's
I always have good luck with them
That's my very own recipe
For just another day in parodies

If Shania Twain's mad at me
It's just another day in parodies
But deep down she want to be Cledus T
Cha-ching, cha-ching
I wish the cash register would ring
Oh I bet that Weird Al would agree
It's just another day in parodies
It's just another day in parodies"
When Do I Get To Be A Woman,Sarah Johns,Country,"When do I just get to be a woman
Sip some wine and do my nails
Bubble bath 'til the candles melt
All week long I'm everything else

When do I just get to be a woman
Break from all this reality
That's what every tired girl needs
When do I just get to be a woman

I make our bed, his lunch
I put my make-up on while I run by the daycare
I kiss her cheek, then I'm gone
Punch a clock, then I'm home to more work waitin' there
I fold and mop, I'm never through
And I don't mind but if this job's on weekends too

When do I just get to be a woman
Shop for shoes and real tight jeans
Pamper myself just like a queen
When do I just get to be a woman

God knows I'm thankful, I don't mean to whine
There's just some days when I could use a break
A little Sarah time

So when do I just get to be a woman
A longneck night in a real short dress
Make him stare like we just met
Take him home and then take his breath

When do I just get to be a woman
Break from all this reality
You girls know what I mean
When do I just get to be a woman"
Watermelon Crawl,Tracy Byrd,Country,"I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead

Well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law if you drink
Don't drive do the watermelon crawl

When the band started playin' the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin' that you ain't ever seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on lets go
She dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed

She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law if you drink
Don't drive do the watermelon crawl

If your ever down in georgia around about July
If you ain't in a hurry then you aw to stop by
I can guarantee that you're goin' have a ball
Learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law if you drink
Don't drive do the watermelon crawl

Yeah do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all
Do the watermelon crawl"
Tryin' To Find A Reason,Martina McBride,Country,"No love can survive for long like this
When you're standing' on a bridge that's always burnin'
Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay

I don't know how long this pain will last
All I know is it can't go on forever
Isn't this just pointless anyway
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it what we know inside
We've tried everything, everything but goodbye
Say goodbye


If your heart has nothin' left to give
If your world feels like it's just stopped turnin'
Maybe that says all there is to say
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it what we know inside
We've tried everything, everything but goodbye

Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay
Baby it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay"
The Jamestown Ferry,Tanya Tucker,Country,"He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me

He said that gone was all he'd ever be

I didn't think that he'd leave me
After saying how much he needs me
But the fact still remains
I'm sittin' here all alone
Missin' the lovin' of my baby
Lord it's about to drive me crazy
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known

It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be

As I walk through his kingdom
Of honkey-tonks and bars
I remember how he'd hold me
And comfort me with talk
He didn't cuss with every breath
He had a soothing southern drawl
Made me feel like a lady through it all

He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry

Don't Tell Mama,Gary Allan,Country,"I was headed north on highway 5
On a star-lit Sunday night
When a pickup truck flew by me
Out of control
As I watched in my headlights
He swerved left then back right
He never hit the brakes
As he left the road

I found him lying in the grass
Among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
Through the blood and tears
He whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

Don't tell mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world
With mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath

I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay
For our mistakes
Last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

Don't tell mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world
With mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
Don't tell mama I was drinkin'"
Boot Scootin' Boogie,Brooks & Dunn,Country,"Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well, there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scoot boogie

I got a good job, I worked hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scoot boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do, come on, baby, let's go boot scootin!

Oh, get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie

Frosty the Snowman,Gene Autry,Country,"Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
May the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when before their eyes
He came to life that day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Before I melt away

So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

For Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again someday

Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump

Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free

Land that I love is the land that I'm workin'
But it's hard to love it all the time when your back is a-hurtin'

Please let me lay down so I can look at the clouds

Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord take away these chains from me

Land that I know is where two rivers collide
The Brazos, the Navasota, and the big blue sky
Flood plains, freight trains, watermelon vines

Texas Time Travelin',Cory Morrow,Country,"Well close your eyes and dream with me
I'm goin' on a trip through history
I wanna see some sights today
Yeah we'll go back when time was young
And you learned the trigger of a gun
Or you'd be six feet on your way

When the mountains closed the valley side
And rivers held the miners pride
It was the year of forty-nine
Well those days are now gone and dead
And I wish that I could see the lead
Flying from the cowboys iron

I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see
In my Texas time travelin' machine

The day goes on, the sun beats down
It bakes your skin to golden brown
Now your feelin' like a king
We'll pull off along side the road
And see the land ol Jesse owned
And all the times he spent with me

Then along the skyline of the trees
We'll skinny dip within the stream
And we'll flash the passing cars
Then we'll jump into our Cadillac
The tracks of time will take us back
Back to the land off so far

I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see
In my Texas time travelin' machine

You've got to take a look around
And see this land before it drowns
Underneath the city streets
Geronimo he said it best
This is my land I will not rest
Until I'm dead or it's been freed

I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see

Lorena,Waylon Jennings,Country,"The years creep slowly by, Lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But the heart throbs on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
Oh, the sun can never dip so low
A-down affection's cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, Lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months...'twas flowery May
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, Lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, Lorena
Had but our loving prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years have gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them, ""Lost years, sleep on
Sleep on, nor heed life's pelting storms.""

The story of the past, Lorena
Alas! I care not to repeat
The hopes that could not last, Lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
""For if we try we may forget""
Were words of thine long years ago.

Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena
They are within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, Lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
'Twas not the woman's heart which spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty stern and piercing broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

It matters little now, Lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our hearts will soon lie low, Lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future, oh, thank God!
Of life this is so small a part
'Tis dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart."

Wrong side of the tracks
Tried to leave, but you came right back
To the Wrong side of the tracks

From a big old limo sneakin' up slow
Anything you need, you can get it to go

Looks like somebody's going downtown
Tires squeeling, blue lights flashing
Shots fired, cars crashing

Life Goes On,Terri Clark,Country,"Back in 1994

I prayed every night and day
That God would turn his head my way
Graduation he moved on
Broke my heart like a country song
Must have cried two rivers long

Oh, but life goes on
And before too long
You figure out you're right where you belong
It's sad and it's sweet
But if you're lucky it keeps going on and on and on

Then came 1999
My heart broke for the second time
Left me cryin' on the steps
Burned me down like a cigarette
Just like that and he was gone
My heart sunk like a ten pound ston
Hand no right to do me wron

Oh, but life goes on
And before too long
You figure out you're right where you belong
It's sad and it's sweet
But if you're lucky it keeps going on and on and on

My mamm always said that they'll be lesson that you learn
You don't need to know 'em all right now
But I'm learning as I go
And the more I learn I know
The less I want to know anyhow

I finally found my whole world
Little boy and a little girl
Got me a man with a heart of gold
It all came back a hundred fold
And I watch the gravel kickin' up
As he pull in the drive in his pick-up truck
I just smile and my good luck

Oh, but life goes on
And before too long
You figure out you're right where you belong
It's sad and it's sweet
But if you're luck it keeps going on and on and on"
Dress Rehearsal,Carolyn Dawn Johnson,Country,"Days pass me by just like moments
They're here and then they're gone for good
For good
I work so hard at where I'm going
I wonder what I've missed
I can't remember the last time
I picked up the phone just to talk for hours on end
I've sent a birthday card unbelated
Maybe I should slow it down

Life doesn't wait for us
To get it right day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best to make the most of it
Avoid regrets
Take a breath
Realize
Time is irreversable
This ain't no dress rehearsal

I've always got a big to do list
Oh but there's so much more to do, to see
I want to know that I didn't leave ""I love yous"" trapped within my heart
There won't always be another day to
Say all the things you wanna say
So don't, don't wait for the perfect situation
It will never come around

Life doesn't wait for us
To get it right day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best to make the most of it
Avoid regrets
Take a breath
Realize
Time is irreversable
This ain't no dress rehearsal

When the show is over
And they lay me down
I wanna be remembered
For the love I spread around

Life doesn't wait for us
To get it right day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best to make the most of it
Avoid regrets
Take a breath
Realize
Time is irreversable
This ain't no dress rehearsal

This ain't no dress rehearsal"
Rain Rain Rain,Frankie Laine,Country,"Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain, rain. 

Well, didn't it rain, children.
God's gonna send the waters from Zion.
He's good raise his Heaven up higher,
It's gonna rain. (Well, it's gonna rain.) 

Well stop! Great God, stop still and listen.
My God walked down by the briny sea,
Beheld the evil of the sinful man;
Declared that he would destroy the land.
He spoke to Noah; Noah stopped.
He said: ""Noah, I want you to build an ark.
I want you to build it big and strong.
Build it three hundred cubits along,
Thirty high and fifty wide,
'Cause it's got to stand that rain and tide.""

Well, rain, children.
God's gonna send the waters from Zion.
He's good raise his Heaven up higher,
It's gonna rain. (Well, it's gonna rain.) 

Well, after God told him what to do,
Noah began to cut and hew.
The ringing of the saw cried ""Judgement.""
The ringing of the hammer cried ""Sinner repent.""
A hundred years, he hammered and sawed,
Building the Ark by the Grace of God.
After the foundation was laid,
He hewed the timber and the Ark was made.
""Lord, let it rain.""
Behold the Ark was made. 

Oh, Noah.
(Well, he called in the animals two by two.)
(The ox, and the camel, and the kangaroo.)
Oh, Noah.
(Well, they called in Japeth, Ham and Shem.)
(And God began to flood the land.)
Oh, Noah.
(He raised his hands to heaven on high.)
(He knocked the sun, the moon from the sky.)
Oh, Noah.
(Shook the mountains and wobbled the sea.)
(And He hitched his reins to the chariot wheels.)
Oh, Noah.
(Stepped on the land and stood on the shore.)
(And declared that time would be no more.) 

Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Oh, Noah: Noah, didn't it rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain, rain. 

My Lord, then the wind did blow and the Ark did rock,
And Noah couldn't find nowhere to dock.
My God spoke and he whispered low.
Showed old Noah where he wanted him to go.
He said: ""Look a-here, Noah, the rain's done stopped,
And I want you to land on the mountaintop.""
Showed old Noah a rainbow sign,
Said: ""It won't be a rain but fire next time."" 

Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Oh, Noah: Noah, didn't it rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Rain, rain, rain.
Oh, Noah: Noah, didn't it rain."
Home Of The Blues,Joaquin Phoenix,Country,"Just around the corner there's heartache, down the street that losers use. If you can wade in through the teardrops, you'll find me at the home of the blues.
I walk and cry while my heartbeats each time with the drag of my shoes. The sun never shines throught this window of mine, its dark in the home of the blues.
Oh but the place is filled with the sweetest memories, memories so sweet that I cry. Dreams that I've had left me feelin' so bad.I just want a give off and lay down and die.
So if you just lost your sweetheart and it seems there's no good way to choose, come along with me misery loves company. Your welcome at the home of the blues"
Crazy Nights,Lonestar,Country,"From the moment I walked in the room
I knew what I was in for
Soft music, the smell of perfume
And that lacy little thing that you wore
And by the way you're lookin' at me
It lookin' like it's gonna be one of those

Crazy nights
One of those going out of our mind times
You always make it worth the wait
Baby, I've been goin' crazy all day
For one of those crazy nights

The moon is makin' shadows on the wall
Something in the air is calling
There's no need to say anything at all
Our hearts are doin' all the talkin'
You make me feel so wild and free
I think I'd lose my sanity without those

Crazy nights
One of those going out of our mind times
You always make it worth the wait
Baby, I've been goin' crazy all day
For one of those crazy nights

One of those crazy nights
One of those going out of our mind times
You always make it worth the wait
Baby, I've been goin' crazy all day
For one of those crazy nights

One of those crazy nights
One of those crazy nights"
Easy to Please,Janie Fricke,Country,"I can sleep with the window open
I can sleep with the window closed
I could buy me a Sunday dress
But it's alright if I don't

We could go to the movies tonight
Or we could stay at home

Well, I'm easy to please
Pleasing you pleases me
I don't need the moon or stars
Just you, the way you are

Well, I'm easy to please
Lovin' you is all I need
And love is everything
You are to me

I can sleep with the covers off
I can sleep with the covers on
You could play cards with the boys on Fridays
As long as you come home

We could have the neighbors over
Or we could be alone

Well, I'm easy to please
Pleasing you pleases me
I don't need the moon or stars
Just you, the way you are

Well, I'm easy to please
Lovin' you is all I need
And love is everything
You are to me

Well, I'm easy to please
Pleasing you pleases me

Day Is Done,Ryan Bingham,Country,"Let your mamma cry
When the train's roll at night
Let the wildfires fly
In the soul of child

When the day is done
I was born a bad man's son
When the day is done
I was born a bad man's son

Let the coyote cry
Underneath Heaven's eyes
Never speak of death
'Cause only life can rest

When the day is done
I was born a bad man's son
When the day is done
I was born a bad man's son

Won't you save the last dance?
Won't you give the boy a chance?
Before you wave your flag
And he dies in Iraq

When the day is done
I was born a bad man's son
When the day is done
I was born a bad man's son"
Nobody But A Fool (Would Love You),Connie Smith,Country,"Nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me
Broke every vow you made me broke every rule
Who'd lie awake all night cryin' till you were out of sight
Loving you with all of her might nobody but a fool

I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head
All I knew was your two lips kissed me heavenly
Till yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me
Nobody but a fool would love you...

Well people tried to tell me how you'd hurt me I suppose
But I was blind as any bat and deaf as any post
You caught me like a tiger I loved you like a lamb
And knowing I still do just shows me up for what I am
Cause nobody but a fool would love..."
Wanted Man,The Avett Brothers,Country,"Bullet in my shoulder
Blood running down my vest
Twenty in the posse
And they're never gonna let me rest

Till I became a wanted man
Well, I never even owned a gun
Now they own me like a mountain cat
And I'm always on the run

Well I killed poor Jed Bryce
In a bad Laredo fight
I killed him with my bare hands
For the girl I loved that night

Jed's brothers out to get me
He's coming with his gang
And I'd rather shoot it out by God
Than let them watch me hang

Bullet in my shoulder
Blood running down my vest
Twenty in the posse
And they're never gonna let me rest

Till I became a wanted man
Well, I never even owned a gun
Now they own me like a mountain cat
And I'm always on the run

She had spangles on her wedding dress
She had laughter in her voice
And when I tried to put my hands on her
My heart left me no choice

Now was she really worth it
I guess I'll never know
She'll be drinking someone else's rye
When I'm six feet below

Bullet in my shoulder
Blood running down my vest
Twenty in the posse
And they're never gonna let me rest

Till I became a wanted man
Well, I never even owned a gun
Now they own me like a mountain cat
And I'm always on the run"
We Can't Make It Here,James McMurtry,Country,"Vietnam Vet with a cardboard sign
Sitting there by the left turn line
Flag on the wheelchair flapping in the breeze
One leg missing, both hands free
No one's paying much mind to him
The V.A. budget's stretched so thin
And there's more comin' home from the Mideast war
We can't make it here anymore

That big ol' building was the textile mill
It fed our kids and it paid our bills
But they turned us out and they closed the doors
We can't make it here anymore

See all those pallets piled up on the loading dock
They're just gonna set there till they rot
'Cause there's nothing to ship, nothing to pack
Just busted concrete and rusted tracks
Empty storefronts around the square
There's a needle in the gutter and glass everywhere
You don't come down here 'less you're looking to score
We can't make it here anymore

The bar's still open but man it's slow
The tip jar's light and the register's low
The bartender don't have much to say
The regular crowd gets thinner each day

Some have maxed out all their credit cards
Some are working two jobs and living in cars
Minimum wage won't pay for a roof, won't pay for a drink
If you gotta have proof just try it yourself Mr. CEO
See how far 5.15 an hour will go
Take a part time job at one of your stores
Bet you can't make it here anymore

High school girl with a bourgeois dream
Just like the pictures in the magazine
She found on the floor of the laundromat
A woman with kids can forget all that
If she comes up pregnant what'll she do
Forget the career, forget about school
Can she live on faith? live on hope?
High on Jesus or hooked on dope
When it's way too late to just say no
You can't make it here anymore

Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store
Just like the ones we made before
'Cept this one came from Singapore
I guess we can't make it here anymore

Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin
Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in
Should I hate 'em for having our jobs today
No I hate the men sent the jobs away
I can see them all now, they haunt my dreams
All lily white and squeaky clean
They've never known want, they'll never know need
Their shit don't stink and their kids won't bleed
Their kids won't bleed in the damn little war
And we can't make it here anymore

Will work for food
Will die for oil
Will kill for power and to us the spoils
The billionaires get to pay less tax
The working poor get to fall through the cracks
Let 'em eat jellybeans let 'em eat cake
Let 'em eat shit, whatever it takes
They can join the Air Force, or join the Corps
If they can't make it here anymore

And that's how it is
That's what we got
If the president wants to admit it or not
You can read it in the paper
Read it on the wall
Hear it on the wind
If you're listening at all
Get out of that limo
Look us in the eye
Call us on the cell phone
Tell us all why

In Dayton, Ohio
Or Portland, Maine
Or a cotton gin out on the great high plains
That's done closed down along with the school
And the hospital and the swimming pool
Dust devils dance in the noonday heat
There's rats in the alley
And trash in the street
Gang graffiti on a boxcar door
We can't make it here anymore"
Hello Little Bluebird,Donna Fargo,Country,"Hello little bluebird I know how you feel
One time I thought I'd never learn too
But someone came along and helped me like I'm helping you
And if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune kept you down this time
But there's usually a reason for it all
You'll run into things that hurt you all the time
And the higher up the harder that you fall

First thing you have to do is be sure you wanna fly
Cause no one in the world can do it for you
Then practice what you learn by doin' all that you can do
'Cause if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune...

So go spread your little bluebird wings and fly away
May the melodies of love always be with you
And someday you'll help someone remember what I'm telling you
If I can fly I'll bet you can too
La la da da la la la la if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too

You'll Always Have Someone,Willie Nelson,Country,"Discontent, you must leave,
Leaving love, leaving me.
So go away for your dreams to come true.
But should young dreams grow old,
And warm friendships grow cold,
There'll be someone waiting for you. 

And if you ever find,
That fate is unkind,
An' the devil starts takin' his dues.
When your fair weather friends,
Leave when fair weather ends,
There'll be someone waiting for you. 

You'll always have someone who loves you.
You're never alone, don't you see?
And when your world's slowin' down,
You'll need someone around:
Let that someone always be me. 

You'll always have someone who loves you.
You're never alone, don't you see?
And when your world's slowin' down,
You'll need someone around:
An' let that someone always be me."
Footprints In The Snow,Bill Monroe,Country,"Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground

I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground

Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
For I found her when the snow was on the ground"

I Couldn't keep From Crying,Marty Robbins,Country,"I saw you walking by his side 
Heard you whisper all those lies 
And I couldn't keep from crying 
You sang him love songs tenderly 
Just the way you sang to me 
And I couldn't keep from crying 

Saw you capture all his charms 
As you nestled in his arms 
With his pretty words and ways 
In your heart he took my place 

I stood and watched him steal a kiss 
From two lips I know I'll miss 
And I couldn't keep from crying."
Five Pound Bass,Robert Earl Keen,Country,"Up this morning
Before the sun
Fixed me some coffee and a honey bun
Jumped in my pickup
Gave her the gas
I'm goin' out to catch a five pound bass

Down by the lake side
Just off the ramp
All them people sleeping in their fishing camp
Some out in the pup tents
Some out on the grass
They all be dreaming 'bout that five pound bass

The early birdie always gets his worm
Me I always get my wish
When you're talking 'bout that five pound bass son
The early wormy gets the fish

Jumped in my john boat
I stow my gear
I fire her up and when I am in the clear
I sail across that water
As smooth as glass
Ready here I come you five pound bass

I find a perfect spot
Some old dead trees
Back in a canyon where you cain't feel no breeze
I tie my lure
I make my cast
It's breakfast time you five pound bass

That old sun is rising
That water is clear
I watch my lure as it's flying through the air
I see a ripple
I hear a splash
Lord have mercy, It's a five pound bass

spoken:
That's a five pound bass son
Aw it's big as a god damned baby"

I'm just the reckless kind
And I don't wanna leave you to pick up the pieces
Oh no matter how I try

Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

I can't look in your eyes and tell you a lie

Oh but darlin' the fact is
I'm always atracted to everything I shouldn't do
Oh so you better know, before I lose control


Before we throw it all to chance
Girl your welcome to stay, but all I've got to say
Before you lay your heart in my hands

Yeah I break everything I touch

Geisha Girl,Hank Locklin,Country,"Have you ever heard a love song that you didn't understand
Well you've met her in a teahouse on the Island of Japan
And have you ever traveled over a many thousand miles
To see a pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style
They read it in the Tea Leaves and it's written in the sand
I found love by the heartful in the foreign distant land
Tell the homefolks that I'm happy with someone that's true I know
I love a pretty Geisha girl where the ocean breezes blow

I have stood and watched the sunrise from the waters of the sea
And wondered how much beauty in this whole world can there be
My dreams are all worth dreaming and it makes my life worth while
To see my pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style
They read it in the Tea Leaves..."
Cold Gin,Hayseed Dixie,Country,"My heater's broke and I'm so tired

You know it'll always win
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing

It's time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
The cheapest stuff is all I need
To get me back on my feet again

It's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together

It's cold gin time again

When She Cries,Restless Heart,Country,"The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries"
Ridin' Out The Storm,RODNEY CROWELL,Country,"The New York City winter comes in cold grey sheets of steel
A numbness in his hands and feet is all that he can feel
Alcohol and sterno turns a doorway to a bed
And the ghost of who he might have been lives on inside his head

In a canyon made of brownstone on a sidewalk icy black
He wanders nearly barefoot with his righteousness intact
A man of many mansions in a cardboard box replete
And he lies sleeping with an angel while his heart pretends to beat

Ah the wind blows down on Lonely Street like an ice pick through the air
Midst the Sunday times and thr coffee grinds and thrwino's in Times Square
Five flights up on Easy Street you know she's safe and warm
And way down low 'neath a foot of snow he's a-ridin' out the storm

I offered him my winter coat, politely he refused
Like an educated man he spoke with words I seldom use
He said I don't need pity for these choices are my own
He bowed his head just slightly and then quietly moved along

Ah the wind blows down on Lonely Street like an ice pick through the air
Midst the Sunday times and the coffee grinds and the wino's in Times Square
Five flights up on Easy Street you know she's safe and warm
And way down low 'neath a foot of snow he's a-ridin' out the storm

Well its not like he's a victim of the homeless life he stalks
Nor helpless to get back across the fine line that he walks
Riding out the storm means yesterday's already spent
Tomorrow don't mean nothing it won't even make a dent

Ah the wind blows down on Lonely Street like an ice pick through the air
Midst the Sunday times and the coffee grinds and the wino's in Times Square
Five flights up on Easy Street you know she's safe and warm
And way down low 'neath a foot of snow he's a-ridin' out the storm

Ridin' out, ridin' out, ridin' out
Ridin' out, ridin' out, ridin' out
Ridin' out, ridin' out, ridin' out
Ridin' out, ridin' out, ridin' out"

Your Everything,Keith Urban,Country,"The first time I looked in your eyes I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face I felt
What I'd never felt with anyone else

I wanna give back what you've given to me
And I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me who I really am
I wanna be more than just your man

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
Be the hand that lifts your veil
Be the moon that moves your tides
The sun comin' up in your eyes
Be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreamin' of and more
So much more
I wanna be your everything

When you wake up I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out to me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
Be the hand that lifts your veil
Be the moon that moves your tides
The sun comin' up in your eyes
Be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreamin' of and more
So much more
I wanna be your everything

Be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreamin' of and more
So much more
I wanna be your everything

The Ways Of A Woman In Love,Johnny Cash,Country,"You've cut out your dancing'
And you never see a show
The girls come by to pick you up
And you hardly ever go
It seems your head is in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love

I go by your house at night
In the hopes that I can see
The guy who's got you all worked up
I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreamin' of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night
I've laid awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much
You've hurt my foolish pride

I recall your kisses
The times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you
You're sittin' in the light
Missing all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love."
Pop A Top,Jim Ed Brown,Country,"Pop a top again
I've just got time for one more round
Set 'em up my friend then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile and did awhile but it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops streaming down his face?

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Another one my friend then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

All to me is misery and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me is not what I prefer
So it's either here a drinking beer or home remembering her

Pop a top again"
He Got You,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"He got the sunshine, I got the rain
He got your loving, I got the pain
He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the mem'ries, he got you.

He got your good times, I got the bad
He got your sweet side, I got the sad
He got forever to make your dreams come true
I got your letter goodbye, he got you.

Sometimes the wine taste bitter
Sometimes the wine taste sweet
Sometimes the only road I can see
Leads me right back to your feet.

He got the sunshine, I got the rain
He got your loving, I got the pain
He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the mem'ries, he got you.

He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the mem'ries, he got you.

He got you baby, he got you

You Do The Math,Brad Paisley,Country,"With seven billion people in this world,
I can't believe your still a single girl,
I bet you're thinking you're better off on your own,
But the best things in life,
Just can't be done alone.

It takes two to make love baby,
I'm sure of that,
I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.

Being single has been kinda fun,
But I can see you with me ridin' shotgun,
I'll take you baby anywhere you wanna go,
And together we can have more fun than we can have alone.

It takes two to make love baby,
I'm sure of that,
I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.

I ain't never been a number's guy, but sure enough,
I look into your eyes and all adds up.

It takes two to make love baby,
I'm sure of that,
I'm one, you're one,
You do the math.

I'm one, you're one,
You do the math."
Crazy,Kenny Rogers,Country,"Girl, there are no words to say
What I feel in my heart
You, you're on my mind night and day
And it hurts me when we're apart
When you're not here by my side
There is nothing in this world for me

I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think I'm crazy
This is where I'll always be
I will always need your love

Now, I can see every dream
When I look in your eyes
Though, things never are what they seem
There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever

I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think I'm crazy
This is where I'll always be
And I need you with me
'Cause you are the dream
That finally came true for me
And all my life there'll be no one else
If I looked all my life there could be no one else
And for the rest of my life all I need is you

I guess I'm crazy"
Why Oh Why Live A Lie,Dale Watson,Country,"The talk you talk ain't the walk you walk,
Why oh why live a lie,
The word's you speak you don't really mean,

You're My Better Half,Keith Urban,Country,"Car door slams, it's been a long day at work

The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there.

And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close
And you hold me tight.

That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half.

They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
'Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in.

And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close
And you me tight.

It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last

With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain

From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

Joe's Place,Joe Nichols,Country,"There's a place called Joe's
Where some of us go
When the hard working day is through
Through the neon smoke
We laugh and tell jokes
And throw down a cold one or two
There's a jukebox that's full of records
By Willie, Haggard and Jones
There's a picture of Elvis and ol' John Wayne
Hanging side by side on the wall

Down at Joe's place
It's still the old way
Pickled eggs in a jar
And a blue ribbon sign
Ol' boys and bankers 
Sitting side by side
Down at Joe's place
Down at Joe's place

Allong about midnight
A few hangers on
Are still hanging out at the bar
If the telephone rings
It's an understood thing
Joe don't know where they are
At a table in the corner
There's a young man and an empty chair
His head in his hands, tears in his eyes
And a girlfriend's ring lying there

Down at Joe's place
It's still the old way
Pickled eggs in a jar
And a blue ribbon sign
Ol' boys and bankers 
Sitting side by side
Down at Joe's place
Down at Joe's place"
Young,Kenny Chesney,Country,"Lookin' back now, well it makes me laugh,
We were growin' our hair,
We were cuttin' class,
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
We were strikin' matches just to watch 'em burn.

Listen to our music just a little too loud,
We were hangin' in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train trestle but we had no fear,

Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young

Talked a good game, when we were out with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy,
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll teeshirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, young, Yeah and wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over

But will there be enough to keep on burning

You Never Leave,Jack Ingram,Country,"I don't know why you surprise me
You've said it all before
How you've sold yourself short
And you deserve more

But you never leave
You wake up in the morning
You've slept another one off
You say, ""I'm sorry I just got lost
Feeling alone and out of touch""
But you'd never leave
You'd never leave
Now you see
That you still love me

And I'm sorry that when things get strange
You look at me to lay the blame
But I love you more than you think you know
So don't be surprised if I'm the one to go

'Cause you'd never leave
You'd never leave
You're waiting on me
To set you free
You'd never leave

And I dream at night I'm lying
Right there next to you
And I dream if we keep trying
We'll pull through
But I wake up screaming
And no one's there
And I realize that you weren't so scared
To be the one walking out the door
And if I had been what you were looking for

You'd never leave
You'd never leave
If you were counting on me
To set you free
You'd never leave
You never leave
You set yourself free
I've got your memory
You never leave"

A picture perfect afternoon 
Birds upon the wing, I can hear them sing 
Chirping out a happy tune 
But I'm walkin' around with my head hanging down 
Got a reason for feeling this way 
Since you've been gone things look so wrong 
The sky's got the blues today 

The sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you 
That old sky's got the blues, and I've got nothing to look up to

Loving all this warm sunshine 
So many things to do, beneath a sky of blue 
Not a worry on their minds 
Oh but I could stand a change, some clouds or some rain 
Now ain't that sad to say, but it could take a turn 
As far as I'm concerned, the sky's got the blues today 

Yeah, the sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you

I Ain't Living Long Like This,Waylon Jennings,Country,"I look for trouble and I found it son

You make one move and you're a dead man friend
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
And left me reeling on a steel reel rack
They got'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives
Son of a carhop and some all night dives
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Don't let them take you to the man down town
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

I live with Angel she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom in the jailhouse now

Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

We All Fall Down,Diamond Rio,Country,"She's Says...

As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up out of the sand
And tied the shoelace that read superman

We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down

She says...
I know what you're going through
She talks through the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it broken in two
Well Baby I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said
""It's okay to cry""

We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down

He's 45 and his job is gone
He's at his desk then heads on home
He sees his kids out playing in the yard
It's been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says
""Honey look at me""

We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee

Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road

Nothing's where I left it before
Set of keys and a dusty suitcase
Car wheels on a gravel road

There goes the screen door slamming shut
You better do what you're told
When I get back this room better be picked up
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

Low hum of voices in the front seat
Stories nobody knows
Got folks in jackson we're going to meet
Car wheels on a gravel road

Cotton fields stretching miles and miles
Hank's voice on the radio
Telephone poles, trees and wires fly on by
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

Broken down shacks, engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin' in the yard

I need a little more bliss

Taking a chance I might
Find what I'm looking for

Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up
I could work my life away, but why?
I got things to do before die

Some believe in destiny, and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best believe that I'm not gonna wait
'Cause there's gotta be something more

I get home 7:30 the house is dirty, but it can wait

To drink some red wine and celebrate
Armageddon could be knocking at my door
But I ain't gonna answer that's for sure.

I Threw The Rest Away,Tracy Lawrence,Country,"I met him in a dive down in New Orleans
I recognized his handsome face
It was none of my business, but I had to know
What he was doing in this kind of place

'Cause he used to have money, he used to have honeys
He used to be society's prince
But he still wore a grin when I sat beside him
And asked where all that money went

Some was spent on gambling, a lot was spent on women
A little on some good Cabernet
Three or four divorces, at least that many horses
Who never left the starting gate
Diamond rings and furs, swampland in new jersey
That week I spent a year in L.A.

I hate to admit it, I threw the rest away

He said money don't mean nothing in this game of life
It's just a way of keeping score
Show me a man whose got everything
I'll show you one who wants even more

Well so smoke em' when you got em'
When you hit bottom, you gotta have a reason to smile
You can have a little piece of the rock
I'll take a little piece of mind

Some was spent on gambling, a lot was spent on women
A little on some good Cabernet
Three or four divorces, at least that many horses
Who never left the starting gate
Diamond rings and furs, swampland in new jersey

She's A Butterfly,Martina McBride,Country,"She remembers when she first got her wings
And how she opened up that day
She learned to sing
Then the colors came, erased the
Black and white
And her whole world changed
When she realized

She's a butterfly, pretty as the crimson sky
Nothing's ever gonna bring her down
And everywhere she goes
Everybody knows she's so glad to be alive
She's a butterfly

Like the purest light in a darkened world
So much hope inside such a lovely girl
You should see her fly, it's almost magical
It makes you wanna cry, she's so beautiful

God bless the butterfly,
Give her the strength to fly
Never let her wings touch the ground
God bless the butterfly,
Give her strength to fly
Never let her wings touch the ground

Give her the strength to fly
Never let her wings touch the ground"
Perfectly Clear,Jewel,Country,"The doorway frames you
A picture perfect silhouette,
Blue sky of regret
Enough to hang you
Your legs seem to tremble
At least I imagine that they do
Then again, it's probably easy for you

But please, don't open your mouth, my dear
I can read all the signs
I can take it from here
There's no need to explain,
It's perfectly clear

Yellow wallpaper peels makes
A strange halo around your head
It's funny how I notice
These stupid things instead
You say something awkward
But I wish that you wouldn't
A whole life of You wish you could's
But just couldn'ts

But please, don't open your mouth, my dear
I can read all the signs
I can take it from here
There's no need to explain,
It's perfectly clear

So I try not to think to much
It only just makes me mad,
Spent half my life loving you
Think of all the love that I could've had

Five years worth of kisses
Are packed in your bags
This tiny moment fits
All the big things we ever had
And I can't quite pinpoint
When it left or what for
Love always steps lightly
Away from the door

Please, don't open your mouth, my dear
I can read all the signs,
I can take it from here
There's no need to explain,
No, there's no need to explain,
It's perfectly clear"

Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight.
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light.
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?

Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down.
But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around.
But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground.
Yes Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down.


Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a Dollar and a dime.

Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye
A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies
Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes"

Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah, life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it
Hey, the chicks dig it.

The chicks dig it.

The chicks dig it.

The chicks dig it..."
Danny's Song,Anne Murray,Country,"People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like him and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
The sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah, and don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right"
Stranger,Kris Kristofferson,Country,"Maybe she was smilin' in the mirror
Maybe I was too, 'cause I was stoned
Singin' every sad song on the juke-box one more time
Honey, they were hittin' close to home

And I said - Maybe this'll make you think I'm crazy
Honey, don't feel lonesome if you do
But if you wanna make a young man happy one more time
I'd sure like to spend the night with you

And she said - Stranger
Shut out the light and lead me
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you

Maybe you got all you got together
Maybe you keep rollin' like a stone
Maybe some old lonesome song'll take you by surprise
And leave you just a little more alone

Singing - Stranger
Shut out the light and lead me
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you

Keep Singing - Stranger
Shut out the light and lead me
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you"
Special,Justin Rutledge,Country,"Well, I wrote your name on the subway
With a marker I stole from the drugstore
Well, I don't steal much, but sometimes I cave in

I put a picture of you on the dashboard
And I thought all night as I drove,
""Well, even St. Christopher needs some company sometimes.""

The mailman thinks I'm lonely,
And the grocer thinks I'm lonely,
And the crossing guard won't raise her sign for me

Blue is the color of a boy who misses you

The mailman thinks you're special
And the grocer thinks you're special
Everyone thinks you're special, and I do too

Blue is the color of a boy who misses you"
Takin' It Easy,Lacy J. Dalton,Country,"I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
It's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

Somewhere far away those night birds call my name
I can hear them singing love songs just for me and you
For a million summer nights this dream has been the same
It's just you and me and the stars and the sand and the sea

I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
Ooh it's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

Every time I look into your emerald eyes
I just want to take you far away
'Cause I know you deserve to live in paradise
And babe you know I'll get you there someday

'Cause I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
It's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind"
What I Miss The Most,Lonestar,Country,"I hear the sound of gentle rain
Like teardrops on the windowpane
A priceless smile in a wooden frame beside the bed
I stare at the ceiling and talk to the walls
I lay here alone and imagine it all
As a river of memories rush through my head
I can almost taste your kiss as I think about how much I miss

Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
The sound of your voice whisperin'
The love I feel inside your heart
When you're wrapped up in my arms so close
That's what I miss the most

I try to rest but sleep won't come
My body aches and my mind is numb
Shadows fall as the morning sun begins to rise
Another day without you here
Has it been weeks or has it been years
I find it getting harder to keep track of time
I breath in and I breath out but it's getting tough to live without

Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
The sound of your voice whisperin'
The love I feel inside your heart
When you're wrapped up in my arms so close
That's what I miss the most
What I miss the most

I can almost taste your kiss as I think about how much I miss
Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
The sound of your voice whisperin'
The love I feel inside your heart
When you're wrapped up in my arms so close
That's what I miss the most"
Then Who Am I,Charley Pride,Country,"If he's the one that's always on your mind the only one who's love can satisfy
If he's the one that keeps your heart alive then who am I who am I
Am I no more than just a rock you needed for a stepping stone
Until the right one came along
If he's the one that live with you inside then who am I who am I

Am I no more than just a fool that held you up when you were down
Until your true love could be found
If he's the one that live with you inside then who am I who am I
Yes who am I who am I"
Smoky Mountain Rain,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"I thumbed my way from LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights ain't where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams I'm comin' home
But tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe'
He said that he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her!
Can you make these big wheels burn?

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I can't blame her for lettin' go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain runnin' down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes!

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way

Pistol Packin' Mama,Al Dexter,Country,"Drinking beer in a cabaret
And was I having fun
Until one night she caught me right
And now I'm on the run

Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

But with some lead, she shot him dead
His honkin' days are done

Houston Solution,Ronnie Milsap,Country,"I've got some friends down in Houston who know me quite well
They'll be more than happy to put me up for a spell

They won't ask me questions about why I've got the blues.

I've got a Houston solution in mind
All it takes is a call on the telephone line
And I can leave all these problems in Nashville behind
I've got a Houston solution in mind.

Morning,Jim Ed Brown & The Browns,Country,"Here in this room this narrow room
Where life began when we were young last night
I feel your back pressed close to me
And hear your steady breathing as you sleep.

Then as the first soft glow of dawn moves silver grey
Like paint along the wall
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have.

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there.

I know so well, that this is all there is
And when we leave this room it's gone
My mind is clear as we walk down
The crooked little steps to the front door.

A ray of sun that ricoches
From off a rooftop light our stumbling way
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have.

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there.

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there.

Thinking About You Again,Shelby Lynne,Country,"I been walking around here today
Like there's nothing to do
Letting all the walls come down
I tried so hard to live up to
And when I notice how much I'm still caring
And I feel what a cold empty stare I've been staring
I realize I've let me start thinking about you again
Well I managed to answer the phone
But yet I don't speak
And I don't hear a word that they're saying
Until they ask what's wrong with me
When I notice the dial tone is blaring


And I feel what a cold empty stare I've been staring
I realize I've let me start thinking about you again
Well there aren't enough channels on the TV
Too much coffee to drink
Well a good book is just a cover
When all I can do is think of you
When I notice how much I'm still caring
And I feel what a cold empty stare I've been staring
I realize I've let me start thinking about you again
Oh baby
I realize I've let me start thinking about you again"

Tell me you love me and will till you die like music you thrill me with beautiful lies
Beautiful lies beautiful lies...

I hear wedding bells ringing I have stars in my eyes
I see red roses blooming a rainbow in the sky
All sweet things come to me in the twinkle of an eye
When you hold and tell me those beautiful lies
Beautiful lies beautiful lies..."
Dallas,Alan Jackson,Country,"Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her

On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
And then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee

By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord, I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground

Oh, how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east

Sometimes Goodbye,Terri Clark,Country,"I've got an ice-cold cup of coffee 
And a paper I haven't read 
A canyon in my heart 
And a hammer in my head 
And a waitress with an empty stare 
That looks right through me 
I'm sitting at a table 
And I'm balancing the salt 
Weighing out my choices 
Baby, It's nobody's fault 
And I'm torn up by these voices 
Talking to me 
You say there's no good reason 
For me to walk away 
You say there's so much good between us 
Who wouldn't want to stay 
But how can I be with you 
If deep down I believe I'll lose a part of me 

Sometimes goodbye is the only open door 
I can't turn back when I know there's something more 
I gotta find what my heart beats for 

I've got a half a page of reasons 
And a napkin full of tears 
From trying to pull my spirit 
Through the pocket of my fears 
As the lunch croud emptys out 
Into the city 
And there may not be a way for me 
To make you understand 
I'll write down the words I'm feeling 
And I'll leave it in your hands 
But the memories of our love 
I'm taking with me 
You say there's no good reason 
For me to walk away 
You say we're meant to be together 
And I'm making a mistake 
But this emptiness inside me 
Has brought me to this road and I have to let you go 

Sometimes goodbye is the only open door 
I can't turn back when I know there's something more 
I gotta find what my heart beats for 

For the passion everlasting 
For deepest dream 
For a chance to love like that 
There is no in between 

Sometimes goodbye is the only open door 
I can't turn back when I know there's something more 
I gotta find what my heart beats for"
She Got The Goldmine (I Got The Shaft),Jerry Reed,Country,"Well, I guess it was back in '63,
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me,
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife.
Well, she said she would, so I said, 'I do'.
But I'da said, 'I wouldn't' if I'da just knew how sayin' 'I do'
Was gonna screw up all o' my life.

Well, the first few years weren't all that bad.
I'll never forget the good times we had,
'Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support.
Well, it wasn't too long till the lust all died.
And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised,
The day I came home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch.
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock.
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said,
""Goodbye, turkey. My attorney will be in touch.""
So I decided right then and there I was gonna do what's right
Give 'er her fair share but, brother,
I didn't know her share was gonna be that much.

She got the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
I got the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They split it right down the middle,
And then they give her the better half.
Well, it all sounds sorta funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

Now listen up. You ain't heard nothin' yet.
Why, they give 'er the color televison set.
Then they give 'er the house, the kids and both of the cars.
See.
Well, then they started talkin' about child support, alimony,
And the costs to the court.
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was.
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake.
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes.
Besides, everythin' I ever had worth takin' they've already took.
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony.
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney.
Askin' myself, ""Why didn't you just learn how to cook?""

They give her the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
They give me the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle,
But she got the better half.
Well, it all sounds mighty funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

Well, she got the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
I got the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They split it all down the middle,
And then they give her the better half.
Well, I guess it all sounds funny,
(Ah, ha ha ha)
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

Heh, heh. Hey, Jimmy, I got the shaft.
But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I let my wife tote it.
I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps.
You get it, judge?
I'm gonna be indebted.
That's my money.
Huh?
Contempt of court?
What do you mean I'm in contempt of court?"
It's Alright,Trisha Yearwood,Country,"You say you've been down some rocky roads

And it's all right

There's nothing to run from
There's nothing to hide
And nothing can change what I'm feeling inside
Tonight's the beginning of the rest of our lives
And it's all right
It's all right

Someday you'll look back when we're farther along
And you won't see a trace of yesterday's wrong
And it's all right
Baby it's all right
Ain't got nothing to do with me and you tonight

Walking The Floor Over You,Ernest Tubb,Country,"I'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two walking the floor over you

You left me and you went away you said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you...

Now someday you may be lonesome too walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt your pride
Remember that I loved you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you..."
Speak,Nickel Creek,Country,"Well I sat down next to a photograph
Tried my best, almost made her laugh
She was my toughest crowd
There in the way
Was a mountain up in the clouds

Well I can't sleep and I'm not in love
I can't speak without messing up
Eyes tell of what's behind
Hers showed the way to a long and a lonely climb
But through failure I'll proceed
She'll see how far I've come

And it's you and me in the sun and sea
I'll offer my arm to yours
It seems to me no mystery
It isn't, so I'll try hard to speak

Well I sat down next to a living hell
Tried my best until I struck out
Movement is not mine
I stood in the way
Pretending that I was the vine
But no failure will proceed
From a mouth that drinks its wine

And it's not me, not my sanctity
These aren't my words to you
It's all clear when it's not from here
So clear, so I'll try not to speak"
You're Gonna Leave Me Again,Clint Black,Country,"Just like a rerun movie
I see that scene again
That feeling shoots right through me
'Cause this time I know the end.

And I've seen it played so many times
And I've watched it frame by frame
And I don't have to guess who loses
And I know who'll feel the pain.

You're gonna leave me again
Just like you did the time before
This is the start of the end
The end of me when you walk out that door.

Think I'll go down to the picture show
See if they're playin' somethin' new
Maybe one with a happy ending
And I'll pretend It's me and you.

But I know that it's just make believe
So I won't even try
To tell myself that you're not gonna leave
That you'll never say goodbye

You're gonna leave me again
Just like you did the time before
This is the start of the end
The end of me when you walk out that door...

Fast Cars And Freedom,Rascal Flatts,Country,"Starin' at you takin' off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do but baby you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby don't move, right here it is
T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank first time feeling

Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up you're standing on the front porch
Looking just like that, remember that

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder 
Wait, baby don't move, right here it is
T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank first time feeling

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby-blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom

The Golden Rocket,Hank Snow,Country,"From old Montana down to Alabam'
I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play
So hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a runnin' on time
But baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away

Break (guitar)

Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true love waitin' in Tennessee
That midnight special is burnin' the rail
So woman don't try to follow my tail
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away

Hear her thunder run through the night
That Golden Rocket is doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name
Your fire went out you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away

Break (fiddle)

That old conductor he seemed to know
You done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song
Said you're worried now but it won't be long
This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind

Break (guitar)

Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl
Let's rise and shine good mornin' y'all
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
When I kissed my baby at the station door
The whistle blew like it never before
On the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away"
The Ballad of The Dime Store Greaser and The Blonde Mona Lisa,Blue Rodeo,Country,"As the seconds are ticking in the corner of her eye
Nothing comes as fast as a glib reply
Like a kid who's tired of a busted old toy
The pleasure's worn thin so she makes a little extra noise
So the dime store greaser and the blonde Mona Lisa
Twist on smiles just to please each other
Until one of them finds that someone new
Well the other one is just going to have to do
Sometimes you get what you want
So be careful what you ask for
Remember what you got
Tossing her pennies in the wishing well
Mona Lisa reaches over for the sleeping pills
Like a jerk that butts into the front of the line
She's got her reasons and he don't mind
Absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder
He's hoping her vacation lasts a little bit longer
And they both have their tickets for the promised land
Still they don't appreciate what they have
They can't see what's right in front of their eyes
They've been looking so long they finally went blind
And they lost what was right in front
Of their eyes"
That's A Man,Jack Ingram,Country,"Saw a story on the local news last night
About one more struggling single mother
She was talking about how hard it is getting by
With no help, no money, no nothing from the baby's father
Made me think about this guy I know with a wife and a child
Who's working two jobs just to get by
Yeah, he says he'd do anything he could in this world
Just to give his young family a better life; yeah, a better life
Oh, that's a man
That's a 19-year-old, modern-day hero man

Those two young Marines over there fighting for their country
Man, they're gonna be friends forever
They've both come back eventually
But as bonds and destiny would have it
They don't come back together
Yeah, the one who lived to tell about
Why he can't even talk about it
Keeps fighting that fight up there in his head
Ain't a day goes by he don't wonder why
Why it wasn't me instead
It could've been me instead

Oh, that's a man
That's a you don't know how hard he tried to save his buddy's life man
I don't know about you
Sometimes, I just need a little reminder
And reach down and find some understanding
Find some kind of kindness

Read about a man who said his family
Had been farming the same land in Ohio for 100 years
Felt like he'd paid for it ten times over
With his own blood, his own sweat, and his own tears
If he had to, he'd be out there on that tractor working
Seven long, hot days a week
Yeah, he's the kind of feller that people get real quiet
When he stands up in church to speak
They know when he speaks

Oh, that's a man
That's a stand tall, walk straight
Put God's share in the collection plate man
Oh, that's a man"
The Seventh Angel,Blue Highway,Country,"I am the lamb of God, the seven seals are in my hand 
I sit beside the father, Lord and ruler over all the land 
The mysteries of heaven have all been revealed to me 
The time is drawing near at hand for the seventh angel all the world to see 

With one foot on the land and one on the sea 
He'll swear with his hand raised high 
Time no longer can be 

I am the seventh angel, the time is near for me to fly 
I'll come before the father, the one who will be seen by every eye 
There'll be silence in heaven before the seven trumpets sound 
Then music like thunder right before the time that I come down 

With one foot on the land and one on the sea 
I'll swear with my hand raised high 
Time no longer can be"
Streets Of Baltimore,The Little Willies,Country,"Well I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she wanted to be
We left our friends and all our kin
Back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was
Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore

Well I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
And every night when I came home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well I tried my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me
So I'm going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore"
Cheatin' Is,Barbara Fairchild,Country,"Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him he blames her
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really is
And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie bout where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that'll take a little ring
And break it into pieces that'll never go back again

Cheatin' is the part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are looking for
A stranger here a stranger there then you turn around and swear
That you'll never go back for more
And lying at night when you're holding him tight
Is sometimes that a cheater's heart just has to learn
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return
The worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mommie and daddy choose
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
But the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose"
Don't Make Me (Album Version),Blake Shelton,Country,"Girl, when I look at you, you look through me, like I'm not even there
I'm trying not to give up, to be strong but, I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place, your heart is hiding
And I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fighting

Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go

Baby, I'm begging please and I'm down here on my knees
I, don't want to have to set you free, don't make me

What if when I'm long gone, it dawns on you
You just might want me back
Let me make myself clear, if I leave here
It's done, I'm gone, that's that

You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it

Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go

Baby, I'm begging please and I'm down here on my knees

The Three Bells,Alison Krauss,Country,"There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love

There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

All the chapel bells were ringing
Twas a great day in his life
For the songs that they were singing
Was for Jimmy and his wife

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled with love

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and grey
A soul which wait in the heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away

Just the lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
Twas there will it was singing
To our good old Jommy Brown
And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find this salvation
Of Thy great eternal love"
Best Of Both Worlds,Darryl Worley,Country,"Well, she's too complicated
To ever be described
Yeah, she's kinda like an angel
With a wild side

Free, she sets me free
If this is tied down, that's where I wanna be
She's my friend and my lover, that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds

Look at that body
Would you look at those eyes?
She'll be everything I dream of
When she loves me tonight

Free, she sets me free
If this is tied down, that's where I wanna be
She's my friend and my lover, that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds

She's always gonna be there when I have a bad day
She knows how to listen, knows just what to say
There's something 'bout her touch, it takes the world away
When she says nothing at all

Free, she sets me free
If this is tied down, that's where I wanna be
Ooh, she's my friend and my lover, that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds

I said that's my girl
I got the best of both worlds
I got the best of both worlds
I said that's my girl, alright"
Long Way To Mexico,Roger Creager,Country,"Roger Creager, Radney Foster



There's a warm breeze blowing from the South
So I need to get going.
The palm trees and the beaches call my name.
There's a bar that I know well there.
You can drink and breathe in the sea air,
Lay in the sun and dance in the rain.
The kind of place where everyone knows your name.

I've got music on the stereo,
Bluebonnets on the passing road.
It's a long way to Mexico, but I'm going there tonight.
Line the Margaritas up.
I'm doing 90 in my pick-up truck.
It's a long way to Mexico.

I know about this out-of-the-way place.
You can disappear without a trace.
Leave the world behind if only for a while.
You could just get rolling see the winding road
Unfolding feeling better with every passing mile.
Even the getting there makes me smile.

It's a place of Senoritas and where Mariachis sing.
I know happiness abounds there.
It's a place where I'll soon be."
In the Pines,Bill Monroe,Country,"The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows

I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home

My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
But his body was never found"
Time To Get Crazy,Travis Tritt,Country,"(Travis Tritt/Gary Nicholson)

I've been working and slaving, no time for misbehaving
Till I'm just about to lose my mind
And I'm starting now to wonder if I'll make it out from underneath
The pressures of the daily grind
I've had it bottled up for so long I'm gonna have to pop the top
The trouble is when I get started I ain't ever gonna want to stop

So as bad as I hate to
It's time to get crazy
It's time to take some tension off
When I get wound this tight
And the fact I'm gonna hurt myself
Ain't reason enough not to
So as bad as I hate to
I'll pay that price tomorrow
'Cause it's time to get crazy tonight

Well at home my little lady's got a toddler and a baby


And a million things she'll never get done
And I know the homemaking is just a backbreaking
As sweating in the midday sun
She's been lifting lots of loads of laundry, dancing with a mop and a
Broom
When she finally gets a chance to party
You better give the little girl some room

So as bad as I hate to
It's time to get crazy
It's time to take some tension off
When I get wound this tight
And the fact I'm gonna hurt myself
Ain't reason enough not to
I'll pay that price tomorrow
'Cause it's time to get crazy tonight"
Cheaper To Keep Her,Aaron Lines,Country,"Your down on your luck.
You just lost your truck.
You can't afford another beer.
Your credit cards don't work.
Whole world thinks you're a jerk.
You wondering how you wound up here.

It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn't been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around

Now your sleeping on the couch at your best friends house watching Colombo
Eating cold pizza in your underwear
Just remember I told ya so

It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn't been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around

So if you're thinking about saying adios
Well, take it from the fool who knows
She's gonna serve ya papers make ya pay through the nose and when her lawyer gets through with you you'll have to move to
Mexico.

It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn't been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats living with an empty bank account

It woulda been cheaper to keep her around"

Saying this one's the love of our lives

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old

When you wake up the world may have changed
But trust in me, I'll never falter or fail
Just the smile in your eyes, it can light up the night
And your laughter's like wind in my sails

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old

Lean on me, let our hearts beat in time
Feel strength from the hands that have held you so long
Who cares where we go on this rutted old road
In a world that may say that we're wrong

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old"

So I opened the lid for a smell.

In one vapourous rush I remembered you well.
How could I ever forget, you're just a piece of poop.

I'm keeping your poop in a jar, until you come back so don't forget just what you are,

Take Me With You When You Go,Tracy Byrd,Country,"You can settle down in Mexico
Run away, join a circus show
Whatever baby, it's alright with me
Take a walk in the pouring rain
Sky dive from a jet airplane
Love like ours is all about being free

There's two chairs on the front porch
One's yours and one is mine
Four wheels in the driveway
That'll take us across the line

It doesn't really matter
If you wanna rock or roll
Just take me with you
When you go

Swim the ocean for a million pearls
Hitchhike all the way around the world
Fly to the moon in a rocketship, I don't care
Ride a camel cross the desert sand
Aail away to never, never land
Imagination can take you anywhere

So be the hero that rides off into the sun
Or a wild raging river always on the run
Change direction like the strong four winds that blow
Just take me with you when you go.

Today, tomorrow and forever
Every turn you make
I want to be there
I want to be there

Or get lost in the blues on Bourbon Street down in New Orleans
Believe in heaven if you want to save your soul
Just take me with you when you go
Just take me with you when you go"

To break down the garden gate

Walk A Little Straighter,Billy Currington,Country,"I remember lookin' up to look up to him.
An' I remember, most the time he wasn't there.
I'd be waitin' at the door when he got home at night.
He'd pass me by to go pass out in his chair. 

An' I'd say: ""Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
I keep trippin' an' stumblin'.
If you'd look down here, you'd see:
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me."" 

He stumbled in the gym on graduation day.
An' I couldn't help but feel so ashamed.
An' I wasn't surprised a bit when he didn't stay,
He stumbled out before they called my name. 

An' I thought:""Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
It's not just me who's watching,
You've caught everybody's eye.
And you're trippin' an' stumblin',
And even though I've turned eighteen,
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're still leading me."" 

The old man's still like he always was,
But I love him anyway.
If I've learned one thing from him,
It's my kids will never have to say: 

""Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
I keep trippin' an' stumblin'.
If you'd look down here, you'd see:

But there's no need for you to wonder
If I need you, 'cause I'll need you

Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you


Too many times I don't tell you
Too many things get in the way
And even though sometimes I hurt you
Still you show me, in every way

Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you"
Duvalier's Dream,Kris Kristofferson,Country,"Duvalier was a bitter man who cursed the morning sun
That brought a new betrayal every day.
He shunned the world of mortals and the sound of human tongues
And blessed the night that chased their sight away.
A disillusioned dreamer who would never love again
Who'd tried of it and found that it was rotten.
Prefering perfect strangers to the company of friends
Because strangers are so easily forgotten.

Oh, it's hard to keep believing when you know you've been deceived.
To face a lie and dare to try again,
But there's nothing like a woman with a spell of make believe
To make a new believer of a man.

Duvalier took the fickle turns of fortune in his stride
Expecting next to nothing out of life.
Till fortune found a girl who fanned a flame he thought had died
Whose burning beauty cut him like a knife.
She touched him through the senses that his mind could not control.
Then smiling stepped aside and watched him fall.
Betrayed by his own body and the hunger in his soul
Duvalier was a dreamer after all.

Oh, it's hard to keep believing when you know you've been deceived.
To face a lie and dare to try again,
But there's nothing like a woman with a spell of make believe
To make a new believer of a man."
All Right,Faron Young,Country,"All right so I am to blame
All right I brought on all this shame
You've told me now a million times
You just won't leave the past behind
So all right my dear I'll set you free

The love you said you had for me
Could not have been to strong
If you can't forgive me now
For doing just one wrong

So all right though it hurts me so
I'll pay the cost your love I've lost
I guess it's time to go

So all right I've cheated and I've lied
I broke each vow we're parting now
But it will have to be all right"
Seven Wonders,Nickel Creek,Country,"When shadows fall he'll close his eyes to hear the clocks unwind
Powerless to leash the hands of time
Kingdoms fall, the earth revolves, the rain will come this spring
And nothing he could say would change a thing

""Seven wonders"" crowed the man, knowing six are gone
And how the great illusion lingers on

He can't enfold the sun or moon, the wind within his hands
But count the times he'll shout ""the great I am""
When all the while, a pontiff smile, veiling his disgrace
At never owning more than second place

""Seven wonders"" crowed the man, knowing six are gone
And how the great illusion lingers on

""Seven wonders"" crowed the man, knowing six are gone
And how the great illusion lingers
Oh, the grand illusion lingers
While the sad confusion lingers on"

And he ain't seen me crazy yet

What Are They Doing In Heaven Today,The Be Good Tanyas,Country,"I'm thinking of friends whom I used to know
Who lived and suffered in this world below
They're gone up to heaven, but I want to know
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away?
Peace is flowing like a river, they say
Oh, what are they doing there now?

There are some whose hearts were burdened with care
They spent their moments all frightened and scared
They clung to the cross in trembling and fear
But what are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away?
Peace is flowing like a river, they say
Oh, what are they doing there now?

There's some who were poor and often despised
Who looked up towards heaven with tear-blinded eyes
The people were heedless and deaf to their cries
But what are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away?
Peace is flowing like a river, they say
Oh, what are they doing there now?
But what are they doing there now?"
Promise Broken,Gary Allan,Country,"I'm out here everyday
Breakin' hearts along the way 
I cause tears to fall
And some to lose it all 
This whole world would be 
Better off without me 
Well, I'm the saddest words you've spoken 
I'm a promise broken 

I'm the ballgame that you missed 
I'm the calls that don't come in 
I'm every poor excuse you use to cover up the truth 
I tell the people that you love 
That they don't matter quite enough 
There's no stoppin' me once I'm in motion 
I'm a promise broken 

Disappointment, disillusion 
Despair, confusion 
I've seen it all in their eyes 
Don't promise you will if you won't 
Don't say you do if you don't 
It's alright to say you'll try 

Well, I get pushed aside
When you move on with your life 
But I'll stand the test of time
In your heart and in your mind 
You'll think about me now and then 
Wonder how your life might've been 
But I will leave you never knowin' 
Well, I'm a promise broken 
I'm a promise broken"
Strawberry Wine,Deana Carter,Country,"He was working through college 
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge 
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still remember 
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September 
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much
Yeah

Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
And green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
And seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Delta Dawn,Tanya Tucker,Country,"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her ""baby""
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride

Tell Me What You Dream,Restless Heart,Country,"All of your life you hold out for love
You give what you have still that's not enough
What went wrong
'Cause now what we share are too many fears
Too many secrets and too many years
Tonight

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams
Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me
Tell me what you dream at night while you sleep

Deep in the night, you whisper so low
I lay by your side I felt so alone, alone
I reach for your arms, you call out a name
It wasn't my own that caused me such pain inside

Blistered,Johnny Cash,Country,"I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed

He's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show

She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go

I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills

And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down

She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
She done got me, oh yeah
She done tore my soul apart, put big blisters on my heart

The Mountain,Steve Earle,Country,"I was born on this mountain a long time ago
Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night

I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home

I was young on this mountain but now I am old
And I knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
Till one night I lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and I went down in the mine

There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And God only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed"

Somewhere In My Broken Heart,Billy Dean,Country,"You made up your mind it was time it was over
After we had come so far
I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
I think I can still find the will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly, go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see
It's somewhere in my broken heart

Girl, I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

There Won't Be Another Now,Merle Haggard,Country,"The porch swing is squeaking and the night is like it should be
The stars in the sky putting on a show for you and me
I got a lot of words to say if only I knew how
There may be another morning but there won't be another now

We were kids together and I've loved you all the years I've known you
With hungry eyes I watched you as your young body has outgrown you
Something deep inside of me makes me want to kiss your mouth
There may be another morning but there won't be another now

I need you, I want you, I love you, can't you feel it?
If you don't give your love to me I just may have to steal it

Your eyes hold the secret and I like the look your using
That certain look of innocence is fighting lust and losing
Slowly the oak tree disappears and the willow starts to bow
There may be another morning but there won't be another now
You're the one that I've been waiting for and there won't be another now"

Picket Fences,Chely Wright,Country,"Chely Wright

Little boys and little girls dream of big, big things.
They're taught at a tender age just what life should bring.
Get a job, say I do and settle yourself down.
But what about those of us whose lives are still spinnin' around.

Tell me what's so great about picket fences.
Paintin' them's such a mess.
And a big back yard where kids can play.
I'd probably never get a moment's rest.
And settin' the table for five at five.
Only means more dishes to load.
What's so great about picket fences.
I guess I'll never know.

Here I am in my prime, at least they tell me so.
And if I go to sleep at night I always go alone.
I guess that I could have it all and someone by my side.
But I can't take the give and take the price is just too high.

Dyess Arkansas,Buddy Jewell,Country,"Would you believe this blacktop highway
Used to be a one-lane gravel road?
An' back when Johnny Cash was just somebody
Daddy went to school with years ago
When the cottonwoods reached to the sky
An' honeysuckle vine grew all around
My eyes well up with memories
Every time I think about this little ol' town

'Cause I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
Ah, but everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas

I used to laugh at all the stories
Daddy'd tell me 'bout the mischief he'd get in
Dream of penny-candy an' nickel soda-pops
Lord, what a dollar'd buy back then
When livin' life was picture perfect
Like a Norman Rockwell paintin' of the south
Lord, I'd give almost anything
To hear my Daddy tell the stories now

He'd say
I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
Still, everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas

Yes, I know there's bigger cities
But there ain't no better town
Folks here don't live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The population sign ain't changed in years
I guess it's destined to be small
Ah, but everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas
Yeah, everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas"
I Got It Honest,Aaron Tippin,Country,"It ain't nothin' but a small frame house on an acre lot
It ain't that much diff'rent from any other house on the block
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
But at least one thing's for sure, I got it honest

Roll out of the sack every mornin', head on down to the mill
Give 'em all I got for eight, 'cause that's the deal
If you'll check out my paycheck
Well, you'll see that there ain't that much on it
But ev'ry single penny I'm paid, I got it honest

I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause buddy if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest

Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And I might seem like some kind of low-life
To that high-falutin' crowd
But I'm plain spoken, straight talkin'
And damn proud of what I have accomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
But, I got it honest

Now when I die, I may not leave my kids a fortune
But I hope they know'd my life stood for things that were important
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest

I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause brother if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest
Friend there ain't no doubt about it, I got it honest"

Since you waltzed into my life
You couldn't leave well enough alone

Why
Out of all the people in this world
Why did you set your sights and single out this girl
Oh
Why did you have to go and
Make me love you
Why'd you have to go and make me
Why'd you have to go and make me

In an instant sweet and strange
Everything about me changed
Whether I want to or not

The Sabre And The Rose,Kris Kristofferson,Country,"Feet hit the ground; feet leaving town
Quicker than a bullet or a knife
Falling ain't no fun when you're on the run
Honey we was runnin' for our life

When Stagger Lee had drunk his fill of moonlight
He turned his burnin' eyes upon my soul
""It's time, by God, to spend this night with someone else"", he said.
""Squeeze a little pleasure from the gold"" (love & glory, children)
We can take it easy when we're old.

He said, ""We'll take us into town, lay our money down
I'll bring you to the sweetest thing that grows
Because the fairest ones in sight are bloomin' every night at a tavern
Called the Sabre and the Rose.""

We swang into the saddle slick as breathing
And slapped 'em once for pleasure with the reins
The horses snorted frosty in the moonlight
Somethin' dark was singing in my veins
Older than the voices in my brain.

He said, ""This place you're gonna see is where they live and breathe
And sink down a little bit deeper every day
And sometimes at night, when the wind is runnin' right, 
You can hear it suckin' thirty miles away""

Then the light was crimson and I found her,
All naked and eternal and insane
Sacred as the mysteries around her like a veil
Nothin' but her prison was profane
All we had in common was our chains.

Ah-burn it down boys
Burn it to the ground, boys
Burn it on down

Feet hit the ground; feet leaving town
Quicker than a bullet or a knife

All the way she ran holdin' to my hand
Runnin' for the river and our life
Slidin' from the moonlight into shadows
Silent as the river as it flows
Swimmin' to the place they'll never find us
All we left behind us was our clothes
And the stories, children.

Sing about The Sabre and the Rose"
Friday and Saturday Night,Wayne Hancock,Country,"Well me and my baby goin' out on the town
Worried 'bout nothing, gonna lay some money down
She's my honey lovin' baby, I'm her man
We're goin' juke joint jumpin' just a fast as we can

Yeah, she's my baby, my honey lovin' baby
She always treats me right
That's why I like, to take her out dancin'
Every Friday and Saturday night

Lord about mornin', 'bout half past four
Me and my baby come a walkin' through the door
Both of us so tired we're about to fall down
We been out there all night, tearin' up the town

'Cause she's my baby, my honey lovin' baby
She always treats me right
That's why I like, to take her out dancin'
Every Friday and Saturday night

Well I been to Memphis, Memphis Tennessee
Down to Louisiana, down to New Orleans
I met a lotta cats that like to swing and rock
But my gal jumps down when they play beebop

Lord she's my baby, my honey lovin' baby
She always treats me right
That's why I like, to take her out dancin'"
Barstool Mountain,Moe Bandy,Country,"I've finally found a place where I can take it
All this loneliness you left behind.
On a mountain that's no hill for a climber.
Just one step up, sit back and pour the wine.

I climb up on barstool mountain.
High above your world where there's no pain.
And I'm the king of barstool mountain.
Pretending I don't love you once again.

At closing time I step down off the mountain.
I'm strong enough to make it without you.
I know that I'll be right back here tomorrow.
Too weak to sober up and face the truth
And..."
Jacob's Ladder,Incognito,Jazz,Instrumental
Slow Like Honey,Jane Monheit,Jazz,"You moved like honey in my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires were burning
You came near to me and you endeared to me
But you couldn't quite discern me

Does that scare you? I'll let you run away
But your heart will not oblige you
You'll remember me like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you

And my big secret - Gonna win you over
Slow like honey, heavy with mood

I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze
And you'll wonder what it is about me

It's my big secret - Keeping you coming
Slow like honey, heavy with mood

Though dreams can be deceiving
Like faces are to hearts

They serve for sweet relieving
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart

So I stretch myself across, like a bridge
And I pull you to the edge
And stand there waiting
Trying to attain
The end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you?
Must I release you?
As I rise to meet my glory

But my big secret
Gonna hover over your life
Gonna keep you reaching
When I'm gone like yesterday
When I'm high like heaven
When I'm strong like music
Cause I'm slow like honey, and
Heavy with mood"
Easy To Love,Charlie Parker,Jazz,"Danny was an old-time Bourbon Street barker
Who wanted the same as Charlie Parker
And always cued-up a ball
Thinking he was one rack away
But even when you run the table
The check still seems small
When it's your last payday

The shallow pocket changer
Who always took advantage of strangers
Tried to make a five-grand grab
With a split second getaway
But he forgot that a bag of money
Ain't worth much on a slab
When it's your last payday

That line about luck just can't be bought
You're always lucky 'til you get caught
Trouble will find you, no need to look
And luck won't help when they close the book

I know a lot of young fellas in here
Especially those on the highest tier
Still want to believe
That Santa comes in a sleigh
They're right about the long white beard
But wrong about Christmas Eve
What's Christmas, when it's your last payday"
The man i love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
That's meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love"
So What,Miles Davis Quintet,Jazz,Instrumental
Georgia On My Mind,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind, Georgia on my mind
Each day, Georgia my honey, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you, to you beautiful Georgia
Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind"
Kicking The Gong Around,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"It was down in Chinatown
All the cokies laid around
Some were high and some were mighty low
There were millions on the floor
When a knock came on the door
And there stood old Smoky Joe

He was sweatin', cold and pale
He was lookin' for his frail
He was broke and all his junk ran out
Nobody made a sound
As he stood and looked around
And then you hear old Smoky shout

""Tell me where is Minnie?
My poor Minnie!
Has she been here
Kicking the gong around?""

""If you don't know Minnie
She's tall and skinny
She gets her pleasure
Kicking the gong around!""

""Just tell her Smoky Joe
Was here and had to go""
And as he departed
The curtains parted
And there stood Minnie
Kicking the gong around

""Just tell her Smoky Joe
Was here and had to go""
And as he departed
The curtains parted
And there stood Minnie
Kicking the gong around"
Isn't This A Lovely Day?,Diana Krall,Jazz,"The weather is fright'ning
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's O.K.

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh!
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Tho' we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter

If the skies are gray
As long as I can be with you it's a lovely day

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh!
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Tho' we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
As long as I can be with you
As long as I can be with you
As long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day"
I've Tried And I've Waited,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"I've tried
And I've waited so long
They say patience and will
Make you strong
But I've wanted and wished for it
Longed for it prayed for it;
The scent of the innocent.

Each time
I walked through that door
Hoping to see
What I'm for
I ironed my shirt and I polished my shoes
And I kissed all the feet of the world

Show me the times when I fail
Give me the strength to be frail
To ask and receive
To trust when in need
When I've tried and I've waited so long

I've tried and I've waited so long"
My Love Is,Diana Krall,Jazz,"My love, my love is a mountainside
So firm, So firm it can calm the tide
My love for you is a mountainside
It stands so firm it can calm the tide
That's why my love,
My love is a mountainside

My love, my love is an ocean's roar
So strong, so strong that I can't let you go
My love for you is an ocean's roar
It's grown so strong that I can't let you go
That's why my love, my love is
An ocean's roar

My love is longer than forever
And endless as the march of time
Till ninety-nine years after never
In my heart you'll still be mine
Because my love

My love is a deep blue sea
So deep, so deep that I'll never be free
My love for you is a deep blue sea
It's grown so strong that I'll never be free
That's why my love
My love is a deep blue sea"
I'm Coming Through,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I looked down at a sparkling band
And only saw my Mother's hand
The things I've earned
They never came too cheap
But then the likeness only goes so deep

As clouds approach the facing shore
And although two pairs of shoes sit by the door
I can't pretend I don't descend
I know I should be joyful now
But time means nothing
Only the love you gave to me can save me
I think she knew

I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now
I'm coming through

I looked down at a twist of lace
And only saw my Father's face
The things we shared
Have hurt us both so much sometimes
We each go places love can't touch

A calendar marks days to keep
The moon shone down
Upon chill waters running deep
The veil so thin that light poured in
The sight was so astonishing
That time meant nothing
Only a kiss that felt like this cloud move me
I think she knew

I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now
I'm coming through"
Battle Hymn Of The Republic,Gene Harris,Jazz,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never sound retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat
Oh, be swift my soul to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet
For my God is marching on

Everyday I sing glory, glory, hallelujah
Everyday, glory, glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
For my God is marching on
Marching on, marching on, marching on

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free
While God is march, He's marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on"
I've Got the World on a String,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"I've got the world on a string
Sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rainbow
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love?

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
Sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, mama, I'm in love

Oh, what a world, what a life
Baby, I'm in love, is it?
Looka here, lucky me, can't you see
Mama, I'm in love?

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go, yes

What a world, what a, what a life
Baby, love
Oh, what a world baby
Oh, I'm in love, yeah man"
In The Dark,Nina Simone,Jazz,"In the dark it's just you and I
Not a sound, there's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark

Now, in the dark, in the dark
I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark

But soon this dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun, fun to be kissed

In the dark, now we will find
What the rest have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
Lord, in the dark"
Come On Everybody (Get Down),Us3,Jazz,"Come on everybody, come in here and swing
Everybody come on everybody, come in here and swing

Move to a rhythm that's smooth, made to groove
Work that body baby it's a party
Shake it, funky ain't it?
Yeah, the long awaited return of fluent movement-enhanced music
Ain't nothin' but to do it
Manoeuvre to a sound that's makin' you wanna dance to it
Nod ya head, clap ya hands and shake that ass to it
Hit the floor, it's yours, assuming that's what ya came here for
Why play the wall'n'all
The flavour's so raw get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

Bounce to a piece that got the spot hoppin'
Bottom to top, top to bottom
Form, a bit of a break from the norm
Converge with a melodic surge and get ya groove on
Amplify the vibe supplied on your hi-fi
Level the bass to coincide with the highs then rise
Partake in a rhythm created to elevate you to a point only we can take you
Notes arranged, grooves interchange
Engage with flav givin' ya what ya crave
Praise the MC that's lacin' ya party
Maintain, do ya dance and don't hurt nobody
As I see bodies bouncing constantly
Ears consume the bom diggy till ya city bound
Get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

Get loose, feel the groove cruise, on a bassline ooze
Sweat drips as the hips of ladies gyrate and the fellas go crazy
What more could ya ask for in a joint that's packin' the floor
Plus a rapper type raw
Define the aspect of rhyme orated
Think how long ya waited to get blessed with innovative style
Providing your motivation
The duration of a jam that sounds so amazing
Cave in get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down"
Bitch,Room Eleven,Jazz,"I hate the world today,
You're so good to me I know,
But I can't change.
Try to tell you but you look at me like maybe I'm a angel underneath,
Innocent, sweet...

Yesterday I cried,
Must have been releaved to see the softer side.
I can understand how you feel so confused, I don't envy you.
I'm a little bit of everything, all grown into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother,
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed.
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, nothing in between.
You know you wouldn't want it any other way.

So take me as I am,
This may mean you have to be a stronger man.

Was to sure that when I start to make you nervous and go into extremes.
Tomorrow I will change, today wont mean a thing.

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother,
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed.
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, nothing in between.
You know you wouldn't want it any other way.

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, child,
I'm a mother, sinner, saint,
I do not feel ashamed.
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, nothing in between.
U know you wouldn't want it any other way no."
Need Some More,The Brand New Heavies,Jazz,"I been singing on your radio
And then you'll see me on your video
'Cause here we are
I know some people come and go
But we're here to stay
And we're gonna rock your show
We're souls promoting music from the heart
We've been keeping it real from the start
Love's almost gone
From the industry where we belong
But your appreciation keeps us strong

Oh, we're so hungry for music
Food for the soul should be our goal
'Cause we're so hungry for something

I need some more
Do du do more
Do du do
Give me some more
Do du do more
Come on baby won't you play?

Don't be manipulated by industry
Telling you how music's supposed to be
'Cause it's a game plyed by those who love celebrity
And that's not what music supposed to be
Al Green, Sam Cook and Donnie Hathaway
Try finding stations where these songs are played
Did we forget to see variety is still the spice
That brightens up even your dullest life?

See this here this collaboration
Is a Heavies and Russo situation
So listen up y'all who fail to introduce
The uh talent that we can produce"
My Funny Valentine,Gerry Mulligan Quartet,Jazz,"You're my funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographical
Yet you're my favourite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smiling?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day

Each day is Valentine's Day"
When I Grow Too Old To Dream,Diana Krall,Jazz,"When I grow too old to dream, I will have you to remember.
When I grow too old to dream, your love will live in my heart.
So kiss me my sweet, and so let us part.
When I grow too old to dream, your love will live in my heart.

When I grow, when I grow too old to dream, I will have you to remember.
When I grow, when I grow too old to dream
Your love will live, will live in my heart.
So kiss me, my sweet, and so let us part.
When I grow, when I grow too old
Sh-do-ya-do-ya-do-ya to dream! Your love will live in my heart.

So kiss me my sweet! And so let us part
When I grow too old to dream, your love will live in my heart"
I've Got You Under My Skin,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so not to give in
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats - how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality - step up, wake up to reality?
But each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you under my skin"
Easy Game,Jazzamor,Jazz,"(Roland grosch, bettina mischke)

Hey balou where do you go
To the river that's running slow
I'm your girl and I'm not ashamed
'Cause I know love is only a game
No no no no no easy game

No no no easy game no no no
No no no no easy game no no no

Hey balou you're running fast
With goose steps out of the past
Can't you see wherever we aim
That love is not an easy game
No no no no no easy game

No no no easy game no no no
No no no no easy game no no no

Where do you go what do you know
Who knows how this story ends"
Let Yourself Go,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So:

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""No, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go"
Dance me love,Silje Nergaard,Jazz,"Your weak afterglow
Can't warm a heart in sorrow
The spark that is left behind
Can't light a troubled mind

Your fire I know
Can warm those bleak tomorrows
The dark must not enter in
So let the dance begin

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark

We move to and fro
We beg or steal or borrow
A love that can fan the spark
And help us face the dark

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance, my love
Dance me through the dark

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance, my love
Dance me through the dark

Dance me, love
Dance me through the dark
Dance, my love
Dance me through the dark
Dance me through the dark"
Stranger In Paradise,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"Take my hand, 
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed, 
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside 
An angel like you
I saw your face, 
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended 
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms 
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"
Stranger in Paradise,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"Take my hand,

The Lady Is A Tramp,Queen Latifah,Jazz,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew
And never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too
From Maine to Albuquerque

Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball
And what is twice as sad
I was never at a party
Where they honored Noel Ca'ad

But social circles spin too fast for me
My 'Hobohemia' is the place to be

I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care, I'm broke, it's o'k
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I love the rowing on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose? I'm flat, that's that
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp"
My Last Affair,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair

Tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair

Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair

I say, tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair

This is my last affair"
Pick Yourself Up,Dianne Reeves,Jazz,"(Jerome Kern, Dorothy Fields)

Pick yourself up...
Take a deep breath...
Dust yourself off
And start all over again.

Nothing's impossible, I have found
For when my chin is on the ground.
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off
And start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence
If you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off
And start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired
Until the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son.

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again
They picked themselves up
Dust themselves off
And start'd all over again.

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son.

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath...
Pick yourself up...
Dust yourself off
And start all over again."
Nobody,Nina Simone,Jazz,"When life seems full of clouds and rain
I am filled with an awkward pain
Who soothes my achin', thumpin' brain?
- Nobody

When winter comes with snow and sleet
I'm so tired with cold feet
Who says: ""Here's two bits Nina honey, go and eat?""
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get me somethin', yes, from somebody, sometime
Well, I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, no time

Now when winter comes all cool and clear
My friends they see me comin' near
Who says: ""Come on in child and have a beer?""
- Nobody

When all day long things go amiss
I go home to find some bliss
Who hands to me a glowing kiss?
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from no body - no time
And until I get me somethin', from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, nobody, no time, no time, no body, no time!"
My Foolish Heart,Billy Eckstine,Jazz,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart

But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart"
Angeline,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"Robins in the tree tops high
Soon will sing a lullaby, Angeline
Angeline

Bashful little whippoorwills
Can't you hear them say ""I will"" 
Angeline
Angeline

The crickets in the meadows
The dear in the woods
Know it's time for singin' in the rain
Until you make up your mind I'll try to be good babe
How long mush I wait
Can't you see my heart's a flame
Don't you know that you're to blame
Say you're mine, Angeline,
Angeline 

Oh. Angeline
Sweet Angeline
Oh baby, I love ya Angeline"
You Are There,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"In the evening, when the kettle's on for tea
An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see
And I believe that you are there

In a garden, when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petals soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

When I'm dreaming
And I find myself awake
Without a warning
And I rub my eyes
And fantasize
And all at once I realize
It's morning
And my fantasy is fading
Like a distant star at dawn
My dearest dream is gone
I often think
There's just one thing to do
Pretend the dream is true
And tell myself that you are there"
Family Reunion,George Benson,Jazz,"Girl
Ooh
Oh, baby

Morning, noon, and night, I'm thinkin' about you
Things just ain't been right since you've been gone
Till the end of time we've taken a vow to
Keep our family strong
But we were both tryin' to grow in our own direction
Soon the magic of two meant nothing at all

So don't you think it's 'bout time (It's 'bout time)
We had a family reunion (Make things right)
'Cause I'm losin' my mind (All my mind)
Without you here in my life (In my life)

Tell me what you want, let's get it together
No more wastin' time on what we're not
You and I should love each other forever
Family means a lot
So baby, let's make a move, find a new beginning
Set your feelin' the same way I feel tonight

And now that we've been through everything, we don't have to worry
Let's put the pain of the past behind
And girl I promise you that love will always stay in our lives

So don't you think it's 'bout time (It's 'bout time)
We had a family reunion (Make things right)
Because I'm losin' my mind (I'm losin' my mind, baby)
Without you here in my life (Here in my life)

Come on and give it a try (Yeah, girl)
Let's have a family reunion (A family reunion)
You know it's a crime (You know it's a crime, baby)
Not havin' you by my side (I need you here by my side)

Let's get it together, baby
Together, together, together baby

Old Devil Moon,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the sky
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I just wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love

I looked at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

Blinds me with love"
Embraceable you,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"George and Ira Gershwin

Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
My irreplaceable you
Just to look at you
My heart grows tipsy in me
You and you alone

The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be naughty baby
Come to me
Come to me do
My sweet embraceable you

I Can Tell,Al Di Meola,Jazz,"I can tell
You are the one and know I can be sure
When lies are real it hurts a little more
I could show you why I'll see right through your eyes

East Of The Sun,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"East of the sun (babe, in the brightness)
And west of the moon (we'll be diggin' a glow)
We'll build a dream house (a righteous pad)
So lovely (where you can really lay it on me)

Near to the sun in the day (we'll be jumpin')
Near to the moon at night (you'll be with me)
We'll live in a lovely way dear (solid duty, I'm hip)
Living our love in pale moonlight (you're mellow)

Just you and I (we'll nix the squares)
Forever and a day (so long, so long)
Love will not die (we're together forever)
We'll keep it that way (forever)

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
(On a June night, kiiss me and hold tight forever)
East of the sun and west of the moon
(Well, alright then, take 'em, buddy)"
Hit The Ground,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Hit the ground, baby

See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground, baby,
'Cause I want to love you now

Hit the ground, baby
I said it's all right now
Hit the ground, baby
You're gonna make it somehow

Baby, why so lonely?

Hit the ground baby
Hit the ground and run

See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground, baby
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground, baby
Hit the ground and run"
Just Another Parade,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"Yesterday's news is tomorrow's blues...
But today I am alive (I am alive)
Today I did much more than survive

I learned to live by the love I give
It's the only thing I own
Shadowed valleys that I've known helped me build my home

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should you be afraid?)
We've seen better, we've seen darker days
So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should you be so afraid?)
Sittin' here watching just another parade

...Just another parade...

Summer will end, then the death begins
Grandma's hands are moving slow
She takes the time to let me know winter's winds will blow
Will blow...

She said look at your sun, he's a golden one...
Makes you turn your pages slow
Is life more precious than we know?
Every day unfolds (every day)

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should you be so afraid?)
I've seen brighter, seen darker days
So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid? (Why should I be so afraid?)
Sittin' here watching... it's just another parade

Just another parade... just another parade... just another parade

So tell me why
Why are you so afraid?
Why should I be afraid?
When you know we've seen brighter, we'veseen darker days
So tell me why: why should I be afraid? Why should you be afraid?
Sittin' here watchin... it's just another parade
Tell me why should I be afraid?
I've seen better... I've seen darker days
Tell me why... why should I be afraid?
Sittin' here watchin... it's just another parade"
Good Love,Incognito,Jazz,"If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cause there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions and promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done
If you insist on making life a compromise
You're gonna wake up to find your world has come undone
All the right intentions and promises are never enough
And soon you find it all gone

Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

Good love, precious and gifted
Can't stand waitin' forever
Good love, no greater feelin'
No one could ever deny
Stop wastin' all the good love

You're takin' your time comin' to let me know
Now you better decide 'cause there's a limit to your games
Let your intuition lead you on
Follow the signs to the place you belong
If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cause there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions and promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done

Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

Don't go wastin' good love
Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

Lean On Me,Gene Harris,Jazz,"Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if, if we are wise
We know that there's 
Always tomorrow

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need 
Somebody to lean on

Please, swallow your pride
If I have things 
That you need to borrow
No one, no one can fill 
Those of your needs
That you won't let show

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need

We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, Gene

Now just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need

Somebody to lean on
Need somebody 
Just wanna lean on you
You can lean on me

Want somebody to
Someone, someone

I Wished On the Moon,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you"
White Christmas,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)
And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)
And may all your christmases be
(All your christmases be white)
(All your christmases be white)"
Lover,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Lover, when I'm near you and I hear you speak my name
Softly, in my ear, you breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

(Instrumental bridge)

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When two lips of coral want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart"
Lilac Wine,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because I brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love..."
Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me,Robbie Williams,Jazz,"Do nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head

Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
That doesn't mean I've been untrue?
While we're apart, all the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will

True, I've been seen with someone new
That don't mean I've been untrue?
While we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Baby you never will

That's the truth I'm a liar
And don't tell your mama"

Surrey With The Fringe On Top,Miles Davis Quintet,Jazz,Instrumental
I'll Look Around,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I'll look around until I've found
Someone who laughs like you

I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear
I look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Won't be the old love I always knew"
Gloomy Sunday,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Sunday is gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday.

Gloomy is Sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let then know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday."
He Ain't Got Rhythm,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"'Cause he ain't got rhythm
Every night he sits in the house alone
He ain't got rhythm
Every night he sats there are wears a frown
He attracted some attention
When he found the fourth dimension
But he ain't got rhythm
So no one's with him
The loneliest man in town

Oh! lonely man is he
Bending over his books
His wife and family
Keep giving him dirty looks
'Cause he ain't got rhythm
When they call him up
It's to call him down
With that daring aviator
He encircled the equator
But he ain't got rhythm
So no one's with him
Loneliest man in town"
Over The Rainbow,Judy Garland,Jazz,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?"
Lover Come Back To Me,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?

You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am so lonely

The sky was blue, the night was cold
The moon was new but love was old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

Oh, I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am so lonely

Oh, the sky was blue, the night was cold
The moon was new but love was old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

Lover, lover, come back, lover, come back

Lover, come back, lover, come back, lover, come back
Lover, come back, lover, come back, lover, come back
Lover, come back, lover, come back to me

Lover, come back, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Lover, come, lover, come, lover, come back"
The Lady With The Fan,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"She's the lady with the fan
When she comes by, hold your man
She made Smoky Joe so ginny
He forgot about his Minnie
She's the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan
Can she dance? Yeah, man!
Every wiggle gets a giggle
From the hick who pays a nickel
To see the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan
She's the lady with the fan
She's such a grand attraction
She put lazy-bones in action
She's the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan
She's the lady with the fan
In fair or stormy weather
She shakes them both together
She's the lady with the fan!"
If I Didn't Care,Ink Spots,Jazz,"If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
Darlin' if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?

Day By Day,Eliane Elias,Jazz,"Day by day, I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone and I'm in love to stay

Summer Song,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Love, to me, is like a summer day
Silent 'cause, there's just too much to say
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Even clouds that may drift by
Can't disturb our summer sky

I'll take summer, that's my time of year
Winter's shadow, seems to disappear
Gay is swanee season
That's the reason I can say
That I love a summer day

I hear laughter, from the swimming hole
Kids out fishin', with the willow pole
Boats come driftin', round the bend
Why must summer, ever end...

Love, to me, is like a summer day
If it ends, the memories will stay
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Now the days are getting long
I can sing my summer song

I hear laughter, from the swimmin' hole
Kids out fishin', with the willow pole
Boats come driftin', round the bend
Why must summer, ever end...

Oh, love to me, is like a summer's day
If it ends, the memories will stay
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Now the days are getting long
I can sing, my summer song..."
Ill Wind (You're Blowin' Me No Good),Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Blow ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)

Go ill wind, go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood, and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today

You're blowin' me no good (no good)

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)

Blow, ill wind, blow"
Meditation,Astrud Gilberto,Jazz,"In my loneliness
When you're gone
And I'm all by myself
And I need your carress
I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just think of you
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes I love you so
And that for me 
Is all I need to know

I will wait for you
Till the sun falls
From out of the sky
For, what else can I do
I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me"
Sleigh Ride,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling, too

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

You Go To My Head,Gabriela Anders,Jazz,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning around in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a zip of a good sparkling wine
And your smile makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head
Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head

You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning around in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
I only hope I can make you mine
You go to my head, you go to my head

You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
I only hope I can make you mine
You go to my head, you go to my head, go to my head

(Incomprehensible)
Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head
Don't have a ghost of a chance with this crazy romance
You go to my head

You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
But only hope I can make you mine
You go to my head, you go to my head
You go to my head

I can make you mine
I can make you mine
You go to my head
And like the bubbles of champagne"
This Time The Dream's On Me,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Somewhere, someday
We'll be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way
This time the dream's on me

You take my hand
And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dream's on me"
Snowfall,The Manhattan Transfer,Jazz,"Snowfall
Softly
Gently drift down

Snowflakes
Whisper
'Neath my window

Covering trees
Misty lights
Velvet breeze
'Round my doorstep

Gently

Silent
Snowfall

Covering trees
Misty lights
Velvet breezes
'Neath my window

Gently
And softly
Silent
Snowfall

Drift down
Drift down
Drift down

The Girl from Ipanema,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Tall and tan
And young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema
Goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes
Ooh
When she walks
She's like a samba
That swings so cool
And sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes
Ooh
Oh
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her
I love her?
Yes
I would give
My heart gladly
But each day
When she walks
To the sea
She looks
Straight ahead
Not at me

Tall and tan
And young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema
Goes walking
And when she passes
I smile
But she doesn't see

(Ooh)
Oh
But I watch her
So sadly
How can I tell her
I love her?
Yes
I would give
My heart gladly
But each day
When she walks

Bewitched,Laura Fygi,Jazz,"He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a week
Since this half pint imitation's
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
Until love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Oh, I lost my heart but what of it
He is cold, I agree
Oh, but he can laugh and I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I"
All Clear,George Benson,Jazz,Instrumental
Spirits Up Above,Jose James,Jazz,"There's a girl that I once knew
Who often had a friend a friend or two
She gave them time love of wit and rhyme
Sublime

They would come from far away
And often gather there all day
To show their love
And see which one would stay

But to her it mattered not
For loyalty was not her lot
Her answer was for not for them
To know

There she goes on her marry way
Though she's only queen for a day
Boy and girl often take this world
So you better mind what you say

My advice to you my friend
Is try to find what it's about
And then you take into account your own

Don't you take some sugar in your mouth
That may be sweet to you
But bitter when you feel it later on

What is good for you may not be good for me
So different strokes
For different folks
Could be a real good rule

There she goes on her marry way
Though she's only queen for a day
Boy and girl often take this world
So you better mind what you say

There she goes on her marry way
Though she's only queen for a day
Boy and girl often take this world
So you better mind what you say

There's a girl that I once knew
Who often had a friend a friend or two
She gave them time love of wit and rhyme

They would come from far away
And often gather there all day
To show their love
And see which one would stay

But to her it mattered not
For loyalty was not her lot
Her answer was for not for them
To know"
Skylark,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me
Won't you tell me where my love can be
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there

Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there"
The Best Thing For You,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I only want what's the best thing for you
And the best thing for you would be me
I've been convinced
After thinking it through that the best thing for you would be me

Everyday to myself I'd say point the way
What would it be?
I ask myself what's the best thing for you
And myself and I seem to agree
That the best thing for you would be me"
Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me, honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone"
Willow Weep For Me,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
Gone my lovely dreams
Lovely summer dreams
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears along the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a sign
And crying alone
Murmur to the night
Hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing
Crying all alone
Weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to me plead
Hear me willow and weep for me
Willow
Willow
Weep for me"
Like Young,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I'm out doin' the usual places
And I'm livin' it, like young
Then I dig me this face of all faces
He's the craziest, like young

He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
He reads Kerouac, like young
He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

We start blowin' the pad around lovin'
And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven
And he's reachin' me, like wow

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
If he were to brush me and go
I'm starting to wear my hair again
Like a square again

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville
And we're makin' it like young
Love soft as April snow
Love warm as candle glow
Love, love is easy to go

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
Without him I'm no good at all
Without him I'm less than a decimal
?

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville or Wowsville
We're makin' it, makin' it like, like, like young"
The World Keeps Turning,Lisa Ekdahl,Jazz,"The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

I want my pretty baby
He says he wants me to
We wanna be together
Hope that is something we can do

I want my pretty baby
He says he wants me so bad
He knows that I got a thing for him
Hope our thing won't turn out sad

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning, world keeps turning

Here come my baby running
Part of me is in his hand
He doesn't close hard he knows then
It slips through fingers just like sand

He does't close his hand he knows then
It slips through fingers just like sand
When to give up, when to give more is
A thing that's hard to understand

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

The world keeps turning, world keeps turning

World keeps turning, world keeps turning"
Night,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Night
Have a good night
And if there's trouble on your mind
There's always tomorrow
So for now,
Turn down the

Light
Have a good time,
Enjoy the shadows
Way too beautiful
To be left behind

Life
Have a good life,
And if the last day ever
Caught you by surprise
Just pretend
There's no end...
To your goodbye"
Jeru,Miles Davis,Jazz,Instrumental
Cold as Ice,Matt Dusk,Jazz,"You're cold as Ice, Dark as night, like a thorn left in my mind
So why should I still long for you
A mistress so impossible, so cruel yet wonderful
Wise men have lost their wits over you

You make me believe you're back for good each time
Then you go and when you leave
You take my pride but I need you still
A man can need love but love never will
You're cold as Ice, cold as ice

And even when you're close to me, you're still a whisper of a dream
What am I to hold on to.
No loyalty in your design, so many lovers left behind
But even though I see right through you

You make me believe you're back for good each time
Then you go and when you leave
You take my pride but I need you still
A man can need love but love never will
You're cold as Ice, cold as ice

You make me believe you're back for good each time
Then you go and when you leave
You take my pride but I need you still
A man can feel love but love never will
You're cold as Ice, but I love you
And I always will
... I guess I always
You're cold as Ice, Dark as Night, Cold as Ice"
Misty,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, whenever you're near
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you
On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love
I'M JUST too misty
And too much
In love..."
Ain't Misbehavin',Peter Cincotti,Jazz,"No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', it's you that I'm dreamin' of
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

Don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

Don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Jitter Bug,Cab Calloway,Jazz,"If you'd like to be a jitter bug
First thing you must do is get a jug
Put whiskey, wine and gin within
And shake it all up and then begin
Grab a cup and start to toss
You are drinking jitter sauce
Don't you worry, you just mug
And then you'll be a jitter bug

Hear this fat boy blowing his horn
He's been a bug since the day he was born
His favorite jitter sauce is rye
I swear, he'll drink it 'til the day he die
Toot your whistle and ring your bell
Oh, butchie-wutchie, time will tell
Don't you worry, you just mug
You'll always be a jitter bug

These four boys playing saxophone
Order jitter sauce by phone
Central, give me Harlem 4-9-4
I think these bugs could drink some more
They drink sauce from morn to night
And never stop until they're tight
Don't you worry, they just mug
They're poor little jitter bugs

Now, here's old Father, a wicked old man
Drinks more sauce than the other bugs can
He drinks jitter sauce every morn
That's why jitter sauce was born
See him shake with his trombone
He just can't leave that sauce alone
Get along, Father, you just mug
You'll always be a jitter bug

There's Rip Van with his eyes a-twinkle
We named him after Rip Van Winkle
Like Rip, he'd sleep for twenty years
If he could get his fill of beer
Rip drinks his sauce, gets on the stand
Soon he forgets that he's in the band
Don't awaken him, just let him mug
He'll always be a jitter bug"
Reaching For The Moon,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"The moon and you appear to be
So near and yet so far from me
And here am I on a night in June
Reaching for the moon and you

I wonder if we'll ever meet
My song of love is incomplete
I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you

I'm just the words, looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you"
The Very Thought Of You,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing hear for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you
My love
The mere idea of you
The longing hear for you
You never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you
My love"
This Guy's In Love With You,Steve Tyrell,Jazz,"You see this guy
This guy's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love
Who looks at you the way I do

When you smile I can tell
We know each other very well
How can I show you
I'm glad I got to know you

'Cause I've heard some talk
They say that you think I'm fine
This guy's in love
And what I'd do to make you mine

Tell me now, is it so?
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart keep breaking

'Cause, I need your love
I want your love, say you're in love
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die

Tell me now, is it so?
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart keep breaking

'Cause, I need your love
I want your love, say you're in love
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die"
Rum and Coca Cola,The Andrews Sisters,Jazz,"If you ever go down Trinidad
They make you feel so very glad
Calypso sing and make up rhyme
Guarantee you one real good fine time

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

Oh, beat it man, beat it

If the Yankee come to Trinidad
They got the young girls all goin' mad
Young girls say they treat 'em nice
Make Trinidad like paradise

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

Oh, you vex me, you vex me

Chicachicaree to Mona's Isle
Native girls all dance and smile
Help soldier celebrate his leave
Makes everyday like New Year's Eve

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

It's a fact, man, it's a fact

In old Trinidad, I also fear
The situation is mighty queer
Like the Yankee girls, the native swoon
When she hear der Bingo croon

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

Out on Manzanella Beach
G.I. romance with native peach
All night long, make tropic love
The next day, sit in hot sun and cool off

Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar

It's a fact, man, it's a fact

Rum and Coca-Cola
Rum and Coca-Cola
Workin' for the Yankee dollar"
Until you sleep,Anna Maria Jopek,Jazz,"Now goodnight and sleep tight, it's time
Soon a new morning will dance in your eyes
Just let the candle and moonlight all wish you a good night
With a kiss, sleep

Hush, hush, hush

My shadows are dancing for you
All your dark creatures are gathering too
And as you call them around you, they won't make a sound
Till you sleep, sleep

Hush, hush, hush

Everytime that half of the world fall asleep
Some are left counting, some slaying their sheep
And that's how it must go, but I know this hole will be safe
While you sleep, sleep

Hush, hush, hush

Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush"
Your home,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Fearless smile,
Hands of wind on golden strings
You melody,
My homeless king of joy
And sorrow,
Listen,
You,
Moon-lash smile,
My silent warrior of love,
Not too far
Between nowhere and goodbye
There's a heart
You can find,
That, can be your home now

Let me be your home now

Swinging On A Star,Bing Crosby,Jazz,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Everyday you'll meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star"
Heebie Jeebies,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Say, I've got the Heebies
I mean the Jeebies
Talking about
The dance, the Heebie Jeebies
Do, because they're boys
Because it pleases me to be joy

Say, don't you know it?
You don't know how; don't be blue
Someone will teach you
Come on and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Yes, ma'am
Papa's got the Heebie Jeebies dance

Say, come on now and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Sweet mama
Papa's got to do the Heebie Jeebies dance

Woo, got the Heebie Jeebies
Whatcha doin' with the Heebies?
I just have to have the Heebies"
Miss Otis Regrets,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She's sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in lovers lane she strayed
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

When She woke up and found that her dream of love was gone
Madam, She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her lover down
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch to day

When the Mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail
Madam, they strung her apon the willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today"
Baby I'm A Fool,Melody Gardot,Jazz,"How was I to know that this was always
Only just a little game to you
All the time I thought you gave your heart
I thought that I would do the same for you

Tell the truth
I think I should have seen it coming from a mile away
When the words you say are
Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

If I gave a thought to fascination
I would know it wasn't right to care
Logic doesn't seem to mind
That I am fascinated by a love affair

Still my heart would benefit
From a little tenderness from time to time
But never mind
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

Maybe I should hold on just a moment
And be sure it's not for vanity
Look me in the eye and tell me
Love is never based upon insanity

Hear the way my heart is beating
Hurry up, the moment's fleeting
Kiss me now, don't ask me how
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in love"
Day In Day Out,Eliane Elias,Jazz,"Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you day in, day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle, one possibility in view
The possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt
When there it is day in, day out
Day in, day out

Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you day in, day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle, one possibility in view
The possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt
When there it is day in, day out
Day in, day out, and in, and out
Day in, day out, day in and out"
I Only Have Eyes For You (03-26-52),Billie Holiday,Jazz,"My love must be a kind of blind love,
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love,
An optical illusion, too?
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 'cause I only have eyes for you.
The moon may be high,
But I can't see a thing in the sky,
'Cause I only have eyes for you.
I don't know if we're in a garden,
Or on a crowded avenue.
You are here, so am I.
Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view,
And I only have eyes for you."
Misty,Dakota Staton,Jazz,"Look at me,
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.
Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
Too misty,
And too much
In love"
Cover Me With Snow,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"I'm gonna lay this body down
Cover me with snow
Chill my burning flesh, it's scolding
Decency and pride

Cold war is over
Opening my pores
The flame each pore is breathing in
Is coming from my core

Sweet and gentle sleepiness
Coming from the cold
Come back faithful punishment
Cover me with snow
Cover me with snow

I'm gonna lay this body down
Cover me with snow
Walk these hours barefoot
Let the snowflakes be my gown

My fingers have no colors
Crystals in my hair
I feel so beautiful
My thoughts have turned to stone

Sweet and gentle sleepiness
Coming from the cold
Come back faithful punishment
Cover me with snow
Cover me with snow

It does for me what I could not
Even when I tried
It soothes my mind and leaves behind
All the times I've lied

I'm gonna lay this body down
Cover me with snow
Fall asleep with crystals
Falling silent from above"
I Put A Spell On You,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine

You better stop the things you do

You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around

I can't stand it cause you put me down
Yeah, Yeah

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You're mine

I love you anyhow
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now

You hear me
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine"
You're The Top,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!"
I Won't Dance,Blossom Dearie,Jazz,"I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, miss you, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do

You know what, you're handsome
You know what, too handsome
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
'Specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos and that's why

I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, Merci beau coup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms I won't dance

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
'Specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos and that's why

Which means when I'm in your arms I won't dance"

Rock-a-bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody,Judy Garland,Jazz,"Rock a bye, your baby,
With a dixie melody.
When you croon, croon a tune,
From the heart of dixie.

Just hang my cradle, mammy mine,
Right on that masoned, dixen line.
And swing it from virginia, to tennese,
With all the love that's in ya.

Weep no more, my lady,
Sing that song again, for me.
Sing on black joe, just as though,
You have me on your knees.

A Million baby kisses, I'll deliver,
If you will only play that swanee river.
Rock a bye your rock a bye baby,
With a dixie melody.

OH!Weep no more, my lady,
Sing that song again, for me.
Sing on black joe, just as though,
You have me on your knees.

A Million baby kisses, I'll deliver,
If you will only play that swanee river.
Rock a bye your rock a bye baby,
With a dixie melody!"

Someday My Prince Will Come,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling a moment it will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, ""I love you""
And steal a kiss or two
No, he's far away
I'll find my love some day
When my dreams come true, come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know him the moment that we meet
For my heart will be skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
When my dreams come true"

Falling leaves, a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icy finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

You and I and
Moonlight in Vermont"

But I must confess' I'll be lonely 
But if you ever need a friend
I'm yours 'til the end
And you can depend on me

Love Is Here To Stay,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Its very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but forever and a day
The radio and the telephone, 
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies 
And in time may go

But, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Its here to stay
Its here to stay."

This Will Make You Laugh,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"This will make you laugh,
I staked my dreams on you.
This will make you laugh,
They never did come true.

I took a chance on the one romance,
I vowed it couldn't miss.
But I should have known to never judge,
A heart borrowed kiss.

This will make you laugh,
I once believed in you.
And for all my love,
You didn't see it through.

Of all the fools, I break the rule.
I love you still you see,
This will make you laugh,
But it's not funny to me.

Them There Eyes,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes
And you have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes

They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm fallin', no stallin'
In a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin', you've started somethin'
With them there eyes

You better look out lil brown eyes... if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
Oh baby... them there eyes

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
You have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
They make me feel so happy

Solitude,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere

I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying

Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love"
The Weight,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
I said, ""Hey mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook his hand, no was all he said

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

I picked up my bag went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the devil they was walkin' side by side
I said, ""Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown""
She said, ""I gotta go, but my friend can stick around""

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

Go down Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just old Luke, Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day
""Well, Luke my friend what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor son
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?""

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me
Put the load right on me

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said, ""I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog""
I said, ""Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful woman""
He said, ""That's okay, but won't you feed him when you can""

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

Catch a cannonball now, to take me on down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fannie, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone, yes

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on
Put the load right on me"

Well I'm goin' up on the mountain to call that baby of mine

We would like to go to the country-- baby can't take you

You only shutter
'Cause your poor tongue
Just won't utter the words

You can't resist him
And all you'll say

The Art Of How To Fall,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Yesterday I fell in love
And then again today
And the day before yesterday
And all the days before
I fall in love with everyone
And every time I fall
I fall in every way there is
With every little kiss

But today I fell in love again
Like I never did before
Deeper than I ever did
Could not have fallen more
Who it was I fell for
I really can't recall
I simply want to truly know
The art of how to fall

I am falling
Again and again
I am falling

The sweetness of a Hershey kiss
Is nothing to a fall
To lose is everything there is
To have another ball
It's nothing less than heavens bliss
To know a moment's time
That all there is to know is
In the art of how to fall

I am falling again
And again I am falling"
Garden In The Rain,Diana Krall,Jazz,"Twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath stars of gray
The raindrops kissed the flower beds
The blossoms raised their leafy heads
A perfumed thank you

Surely here was charm beyond
Compare to view
Maybe it was just that
I was there with you

Twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way"
Don't Want To Be a Fool,Peter White,Jazz,"Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.
I was sure up to now that she was a friend.
I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.
I once believed that love was fair.
But I don't anymore. She said I'm a bore.
My heart hit the floor.

Don't be a fool anymore.
Each time around.
I tell myself it's the game of love.
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again.
So I'll say to the end
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.

Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.
He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same.
He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way.
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.

But he'll never change. He's never gonna change.
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before
I won't look back.
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore.
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again.
So I'll swear to the end.
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)
No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Ooh, no never)
I can't be a fool, can't be. No way. No way. No way. Ooh.
I don't want to be. I don't want to be a fool. No.
I can't love anybody (I can't love nobody)
Walking on a one way street. (Any way, any way any, way no.)
If I don't (If I don't) find somebody (somebody body)
That'll be all right with me. (know, I know it'll be all right now)
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again.
So I'll stay to the end
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool)
Said I don't want to be a fool. (Don't wanna be a fool)
Ever ever again. Don't want to be a fool Can't be a fool.
Don't want to be a fool ever again.
I don't want to be a fool (Never oh never oh never again.)
Don't want to be a fool (Can't be a fool.)"
Just In Time,Steve Tyrell,Jazz,"Let's go

Just in time, you found me just in time

For love came just in time, you found me just in time

My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go

And changed my lonely nights, oh
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day"
Fountain Of Life,Incognito,Jazz,"(J.P. Maunick)

Chase the sunrise, people come together
Feel the glory of the new day
Feed the feeling, gather friends and strangers
Come together make it stay this way

Looking for the fountain of love
We fell into a cool paradise (He yeah hey yeah)
The rhythm of the sand and the sea
Is where we've always wanted to be

I've been looking
(Looking for the fountain of love)
Searching
(Fell into the cool paradise)
I've been in search of paradise
(The rhythm of the sand and the sea)
Sand and sea
(Where we've always wanted to be)
Wanted
Always, wanted

Always searching for a new direction
Your heart desires a better state of mind
Mother nature will provide the feeling
In the sunshine, happiness you'll find

We've been holding on
Waiting for this day to come our way
Holding on
We've been holding on
Waiting for the light to shine our way
(Holding on)
Always waiting
Sayin' (free me, free me, free me)"
When It's Sleepy Time Down South,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Pale moon shining on the fields below
Folks are crooning songs soft and low
You needn't tell me so because I know
When it's sleepy time down south

Soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees
The folks down there live a life of ease
When old mammy falls on her knees
When it's sleepy time down south

Steamboats up the river a-coming or going
Splashing the night away
You hear those banjos ringing, the people are singing
They dance till the break of day, oh

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back there where I belong
Right here in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time way down south

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back there where I belong
Right here in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time
Sleepy time down south
Yes, Lord"
Singin' In The Rain,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"I'm singin' in the rain,
Just singin' in the rain.
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again.

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above,
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love,
...For love.

Let the stormy clouds chase
Ev'ryone from the place,
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face.

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singing,
Singing in the rain,
...In the rain.

Daba do do do do do
Do da do.
Daba do do do do do
Do da do.

La la la la la la

Singing in the rain,

Daba do do do do do
Do da do.

Stairway to the Stars,Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,Jazz,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you"
Pennies From Heaven,Louis Prima,Jazz,"If every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Each red and yella umbrella is up up up up upside down and...

Trade them all for a pack of a gum, sunshine and ravioli (Macaroni)
If you want the thing you love, you must have a pizzioli baby
And when you hear thunder don't run under a tree
It be pennies from heaven, for you and for me

Now come over here boy, Sam

And every time it rains it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
Every time it rains, it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
You find your fortune falling
All over town, all over town, all over town
Each red and yella umbrella
Is upside down twiddily bop

When the Saints Go Marchin' in,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"We are trav'ling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

O when the saints go marching in

O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine

Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes

O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work

If I Didn't Care,Ink Spots,Jazz,"If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
Darlin' if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart just stands still so much?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?"

Let's Call The Whole Thing Off,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that,

Goodness knows what the end will be
Oh I don't know where I'm at
It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done:

You say either and I say either,
You say neither and I say neither
Either, either Neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off.

You like potato and I like potahto
You like tomato and I like tomahto
Potato, potahto, Tomato, tomahto.
Let's call the whole thing off

But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my heart

So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,
I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas
For we know we need each other so we
Better call the whole thing off
Let's call the whole thing off.

You say laughter and I say larfter
You say after and I say arfter
Laughter, larfter after arfter
Let's call the whole thing off,

You like vanilla and I like vanella
You saspiralla, and I saspirella
Vanilla vanella chocolate strawberry
Let's call the whole thing off

But oh if we call the whole thing of then we must part
And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my heart

So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters
For we know we need each other so we
Better call the calling off off,
Let's call the whole thing off.

I say father, and you say pater,
I saw mother and you say mater
Pater, mater Uncle, auntie let's call the whole thing off.


I like bananas and you like banahnahs
I say Havana and I get Havahnah
Bananas, banahnahs Havana, Havahnah
Go your way, I'll go mine

So if I go for scallops and you go for lobsters,
So all right no contest we'll order lobseter
For we know we need each other so we
Better call the calling off off,
Let's call the whole thing off."
Never Let Me Go,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch
What would I be without you
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress
My world was overturned
At the very start
All my bridges burned
By my flaming heart

You'd never leave, me would?
You couldn't, hurt me?
Never let me go
Never let me go"
So What!,Ronny Jordan,Jazz,"Miles Davis walked off the stage
That's what the folks are all saying
Oh yes, he did leave the stage
After his solo was all over

Coltrane he walked off the stage
That's what the folks are all saying
Yes, they both left the stage
Clean out of sight

They felt they had to rehearse
Although we know they are masters
They get a real groovy sound
And you will have to admit it

Yes, they both left the stage
Soon as their solo's were over
And if you can't figure out
Their groove I'd like to help you
Their groove, I've helped you

So what"

No Good Man,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"No good man
Lovin' all the no good things
Never treats me as he should
That ain't no good
He's always bringing me down
He's no saint
Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly
Not on me
I'm the one who gets the run-around

I ought to hate him and yet I love him so
For I require
Love that's made of fire
And in his arms
I find
I always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began
There have been other fools like me
Born to be
In love with a no good man"
I'm Glad There Is You,Natalie Cole,Jazz,"Said I, many times, love is illusion,
A feeling result of confusion.
With knowing smile, and blazing sigh,
A cynical so-and-so was i.

I felt so sure, so positive,
So utterly, unchangingly certain.
But I never was aware of love and you,

And suddenly I realized 
There was love and you,
And I, and i.

In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you

In this world of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love, I love to live with you beside me
This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

More than ever, I'm glad there is you"
Come Rain or Come Shine,Robin McKelle,Jazz,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine

Someone I really could care for

And then they suddenly appeared before me

The moon had turned to gold

Sinkin' Soon,Norah Jones,Jazz,"We're an oyster cracker on the stew
And the honey in the tea
We're the sugar cubes, one lump or two
In the black coffee
The golden crust on an apple pie
That shines in the sun at noon
We're a wheel of cheese high in the sky
But we're gonna be sinkin' soon

In a boat that's built of sticks and hay
We drifted from the shore
With a captain who's too proud to say
That he dropped the oar
A tiny hole has sprung a leak
In this cheap pontoon
Now the hull has started growing weak
And we're gonna be sinkin' soon

We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
Everybody hold your breath 'cause
We're gonna be sinkin' soon

We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
We're gonna be
Sinkin' soon
Everybody hold your breath 'cause
Down and down we go...

Like the oyster cracker on the stew
The honey in the tea
The sugar cubes, one lump or two?
No thank you, none for me
We're the golden crust on the apple pie
That shines in the sun at noon
Like the wheel of cheese high in the sky
Well... we're gonna be sinkin' soon"
Mr. Wonderful,Peggy Lee,Jazz,"Why this feeling? Why this glow?
Why the thrill when you say hello?
It's a strange and tender magic you do
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

Why this trembling when you speak
Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

Oh there's much more I could say
But the words keep slipping away
And I'm left with one point of view
Mister Wonderful, that's you

One more thing, then I'm through
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful, I love you"
Afro-Blue,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Dream of a land my soul is from
I hear a hand stroke on a drum
Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers are face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away
To some secluded place
Whispering trees echo their sighs
Passionate pleas, tender replies

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers in flight
Upward they climb
Burst at the height
Slowly subside
My slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it's not a dream
The two are you and me

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue"
Blue Rose,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Blue as the crying sky
With no thorn, and no thistle
Only an open face
Staring at the waking world

Maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

Her arms stretch wide
To receive life
And her roots go deep into the black earth for strength
And she blooms

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

She blooms while the people sleep
Only the travelers see her
To those who rise with the noon day sun
She is a closed mystery

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Oh, maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine"
That Old Black Magic,Marilyn Monroe,Jazz,"That old black magic has me in its spell,
That old black magic that you weave so well.
Those icy fingers up and down my spine,
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine,
The same old tingle that I feel inside,
And then that elevator starts its ride,
And, baby, down and down I go,
Round and round I go,
Like a leaf that's caught in a tide.
I shoud stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm a flame,
A flame with such a burning desire,
That only your kiss can put out the fire,
For you're the lover that I have waited for,
The mate that Fate had me created for.
And every time your lips meet mine, darling,
Down and down I go,
Round and round I go,
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in,
Under that old black magic called love!"
Out Of This World,June Christy,Jazz,"You're clear out of this world
When I am looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was so high
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a laurel life

And I after waiting so long for the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from the long and lonely nighttime
And despite time, here you are

I'd cry out of this world
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you

After waiting so long for the right time
After reaching so long for a star
And at once from the long and lonely nighttime
And despite time, here you are

I'd cry out of this world
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you

You're clear, out of this world
Out of this world, out of this world"
Nosey Joe,The Brian Setzer Orchestra,Jazz,"Written by J. Lieber and M. Stoller

There's a man in town all the women know
He goes by the name of Nosey Joe
He don't care if they're married
He takes his pick
Long as they're women, he's ready to stick

His big nose in their business
His big nose in their business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

He ain't good lookin' and he ain't big and strong
The guy's got a nose that's four foot long
I'm tellin' you women, this ain't no jive
If you get too close this man will drive

His big nose in your business
His big nose in your business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

I saw him just the other day
Tried to steal my gal away
He offered her money
He offered her love
She said thank you sir, but please don't shove

Your big nose in my business
Your big nose in my business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

Old Nosey finally lost his life
Messin' with my buddy's wife
My buddy caught him with his chick
Chopped off his nose, now he can't stick

His big nose in my business
His big nose in my business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know"
Georgia On My Mind,Mildred Bailey,Jazz,"Melodies bring memories
That linger in my heart
Make me think of Georgia
Why did we ever part?

Some sweet day when blossoms fall
And all the world's a song
I'll go back to Georgia '
'Cause that's where I belong

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind, Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pine

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind

Always on my mind though
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly but
Still in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
(Georgia, Georgia)
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind
(Can't forget you, it's true)
Keeps Georgia on my mind"
How are you gonna deal with it,Silje Nergaard,Jazz,"The storm that is underway is gonna rock that house of yours
Leaving you no place to hide
How are you gonna manage from then on
The wind that is but a moan will soon be howling at your door
You're tucked up safe inside
But are you gonna stay in till it's gone

You check locks and latches
And batten down hatches
But the gale will send flying all that it catches

How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything you had got planned
Seems to come crashing down... there... before your eyes
How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything gets out of hand... and all that once mattered
Is picked up and scattered
You're out in the cold
But you hold on and hope to survive

When the dust has all settled you'll find a way to survive
Still closed up or open wide
How are you gonna play it from now on
The storm has passed and you're relieved
Love's still alive
It could have curled up and died
There is no way to play it when it's gone

You check locks and latches
And batten down hatches
But the gale will send flying all that it catches

How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything you had got planned
Seems to come crashing down... there... before your eyes
How are you gonna deal with it, baby?
When everything gets out of hand... and all that once mattered
Is picked up and scattered
You're out in the cold
But you hold on and hope to survive"
If My Heart Could Only Talk,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"If my heart could only talk
Heaven would be mine
If my heart could only talk
Life would be divine
You would hear my song of love so tender
It would thrill you until you willingly surrender

If my heart could only talk
Dreams would all come true
'Neath the starlight I would walk
Hand in hand with you
I would have to seek your lips
Thrill you to your fingertips
If my heart could onlitalk

If my heart could only talk
Dreams would all come true
'Neath the starlight I would walk
Hand in hand with you
I would have to seek your lips
Thrill you to your fingertips
If my heart could only talk"
Wish I Could (Live),Norah Jones,Jazz,"We met in a place I used to go
Now I just walk by it for show
Can't bear to go in without you, you know
Wish I could
Wish I could

But Annie is standing in the door
With a look on her face I can't just ignore
She tells me that her heart is sore
And pulls me in
She pulls me in

She says ""love in the time of war is not fair""
""He was my man but they didn't care""
""Sent him far away from here""
""No goodbye""
""No goodbye""

I don't tell her that I once loved you too
Or about all the things we used to do
I kiss her hair and think of you
Walking down
The road you found

We met in a place I used to go
Now I only walk by it slow
Can't bear to go in without you, you know
Wish I could
Wish I could
Wish I could
Wish I could"
Georgia On My Mind,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Georgia
Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia
Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you
Georgia
Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind"
Basin Street Blues,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Won't you come and go with me
Down that Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Come along with me on, down to new orleans

Now the band's there to greet us
Old friends will meet us
Where all them folks goin' to the St. Louis cemetery meet
Heaven on earth, they call it basin street

I'm tellin' ya, basin street is the street
Where all them characters from the first street they meet
New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never miss them rice and beans
Way down south in New Orleans

They'll be huggin' and a kissin'
That's what I been missin'
And all that music lord, if you just listen
New orleans, I got them basin street blues

Now ain't you glad you went with me
On down that Mississippi
We took a boat to the land of dreams
Heaven on earth they call it basin street"
Chattanooga Choo Choo,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"(Hi there Tex, what you say)
Step aside partner, it's my day
Bend an ear and listen to my version
(Of a really solid Tennesse excursion)

Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
(Yes yes track twenty-nine)
Boy, you can gimme a shine

(Can you afford
To board the Chattanooga choo choo?)
I've got my fare
(And just a trifle to spare)

You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
(Then to have your ham an' eggs in Carolina)

When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
(Woo, woo, Chattanooga there you are)

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace (doo doo)
I used to call ""Funny Face""

She's gonna cry
Until I tell her that I'll never roam
(So Chattanooga choo choo)
Won't you choo-choo me home?

(Chattanooga Chattanooga)
Get aboard
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)
All aboard
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)

(Chattanooga choo choo)
Won't you choo-choo me home?

Little Farley,Harry Connick_ Jr.,Jazz,"Little Farley
Why you hangin' out so long
I can tell by the people
You're runnin' with
That you're singin' a different song
Little Farley
What you hidin in your drawer
Don't you know that I know what you're doin'
And it ain't worth dyin' for
Little Farley
Why you takin' that to school
Livin' out your life in Angola
Really don't sound too cool
Little Farley
Why you wanna take a life
That little girl they laid to rest today
She coulda been your wife
Little Farley
You know that don't belong to you
What you took in less than a minute
Mighta took him a month or two

A boy don't have to be a man
If you can't decide what you wanna be
Then I'm tellin' you no one can

I Get Along Without You Very Well,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I get along without you very well,
Of course I do,
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms.
Of course, I do,
But I get along without you very well.

I've forgotten you just like I should,
Of course I have,
Except to hear your name,
Or someone's laugh that is the same,
But I've forgotten you just like I should.

What a guy, what a fool am I,
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon.
What's in store? Should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune.

I get along without you very well,
Of course I do,
Except perhaps in Spring,
But I should never think of Spring,
For that would surely break my heart in two."
My Funny Valentine,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend,
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere,
And slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day"
If I Should Lose You,Nina Simone,Jazz,"If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in maytime 
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around 
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain 
If I lost you"
When You Wish Upon a Star,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true"
The Ice Hotel,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
The Caribbean's all booked out
And that's just as well
Once I'd have been much keener
On Barbados and Antigua
But just now I think the Arctic will suit us well
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

They've built it all with ice, that's pure and clear
The sofas, the lobby
Even the chandelier
A thermostat guarantees
A steady minus five degrees
What other place could serve our needs so well?
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Romantic places
Like Verona or Paris
They'll always lead you astray
You'd have to be a novice
To ever trust Venice
And those dreamy waterways
And what the tropics can do
I know only too well
So, let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel

Heavy clothing at all times
Is the expected norm
Even candlelight at dinner
Is considered too dangerously warm
And when the time comes for us to sleep
We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
And curl up together
On an ice block carved for two
But then in the morning
Provided we've made it through...

We'll step out together
To watch the sun rise over
That vast expanse of cold
And who knows if we're lucky
We may find ourselves talking
Of what the future may hold
This is no whim of the moment
I want you to realize
Let's go away
To that palace made of ice

Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
The Bahamas are all booked out
And that's just as well
I don't think we're quite ready
For Hawaii or Tahiti
And when we will be
Only time will tell
Let's you and me go away
To the Ice Hotel"
One Of These Days,Room Eleven,Jazz,"Traffic lights and a lot of different voices
A breeze in the trees
Evening sun... oh yeah it's Saturday
Sweet summer music very fine
Too many shiny lips
Drinking too much wine
Flying dresses red and blue
Seem to walk in circles
Like tigers in high heeled shoes

It's too damn hot
I wish I'd fit my shoes
My hands are sweaty
And my belt is too tight
Ooh!
Reminds me of a chocolate I ate last night
It was hard to fight
Packed train bad news surrounds me
Testing my nerves

It's one of these days
Thunder is coming
Rain will soon start to fall
It's one of these days
Light-years of waiting
It seems like forever before you call

Steamy chat
Six White Russians
And a Pink Pussycat
Stumbling on the dance floor
Tripping on my tongue
Asking for more
Staring in another pair of eyes
And another Brazilian Sunrise
And another one
Oops, I spilt some on my T-shirt
Do I look desperate?

It's one of these days
The birds in the trees seem to sing more
And everything around me seems to shine
Oh, it's one of these days
Bright days are coming
And all the good looking men are mine

It's one of these days
Love seems to try me
Finding myself laughing to loud
It's one of these days
The birds in the trees seem to sing more
And everything around me seems to shine
It's one of these days
Wow, and all the good looking men are mine
Oh, it's one of these days
Love seems to try me
And everything around me seems to shine!"
A Fine Romance,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"A fine romance with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge with my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take Jell-o
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins to express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance"
Let Yourself Go,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So:

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""No, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go"
Nature Song,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"When the leaves began to fall
I heard
Nature's lonesome cry of wisdom

All the birds had flown away
While I stayed
And watched alone the sky turn gray

But then winter came on a cloudy night
With the saddest smile in a bag of ice
Told me don't be afraid of the lonely times

Then winter came on a cloudy night
In a moonlight dance with a starless sky
Told me come dance with me
You'll keep warm and wise

And then, on a sunny April day
Spring came by
With sparkling trees and green leaves
And all the birds came back to sing
The sweetest melodies, delivered by the breeze
. To my ears"
Just A Little Moon,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Just a little moon
Shining on my love tonight
The night is open wide
And I lay by his side

All the guests went home
We closed the door to what is gone
And now this little moon is peeking through our rooms

And all else shall be
Quiet, nothing shall disturb
The given bliss, the grace
The new that's in his face
Reflecting that one of my own
Finally we are alone
Here we lay in moonlight arms
A kiss can't do us any harm

Just a little moon
Young and true an just for us
We cannot change the stars
But we can see the moon at last

And all else shall be
Quiet, nothing shall disturb
The given bliss, the grace
The new that's in his fac
Reflecting that one of my own
Finally we are alone
Here we lay in moonlight arms
The day can't do us any harm,

Here we lay in moonlight arms
Not a thing can do us harm
Here we lay in moonlight arms
The day can't do us any harm"
Five O'Clock Whistle,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"The five o'clock whistle's on the blink
The whistle won't blow and whadd'ya think?
My pop is still in the factory 'cause he don't know
What time it happens to be

The five o'clock whistle didn't blow
The whistle is broke and whadda'ya know?
If somebody don't find out what's wrong
Oh, my pop'll be workin' all night long

Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
Won't somebody fix the whistle?
Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
So my poor old pop will know it's time for him to stop

Ya ought to hear what my mommy said
When papa came home and sneaked into bed
And told her he worked till half past two
'Cause the five o'clock whistle never blew"
A Time For Love,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love"
Lazy River,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Up a lazy river by the old mill stream
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along
Blue skies up above everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along
There are blue skies up above and as long as we're in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be
If you go up a lazy river with me
Ah said with me now goin' up that lazy river with me"
He Needs Me,Nina Simone,Jazz,"He needs me
He doesn't know it,
But he needs me
And so no matter where he goes,
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm there

He needs me
I oughta leave him,
But he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his... And I'm here

And I'm gonna be his friend,
Or his lover
Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover that 
He needs me
I've got to follow where he leads me
Or else he'll never know 
That I need him
Just as he needs me"
Everything Happens for the Best,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Always blue all in a mist
It's plain as can be
You're so mean to me
But everything happens for the best
You always play around
You're running my heart so deep in the ground
That O.K. everything happens for the best
I loved you so madly
Knew you would be true
Now this thing has happened dear
It's over all over because we're through
So sorry dear it end this way
Since the world begin
The old folks say
Everything happens for the best

I loved you so madly
Knew you would be true
Now this thing has happened dear
It's over all over because we're through
So sorry dear it end this way
Since the world begin
The old folks say
Everything happens for the best"
New Orleans,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"If you've never seen a quaint old Southern city
Just think of New, think of New Orleans

If you've never seen that town, boy, it's a pity
There's nothing like, nothing like New Orleans

It will remind you old fashioned lace
A glass of wine will greet your smiling face

And if you ever see a black-eyed gal like mine, boy
Oh, then you're right in it, right in New Orleans"
Makin' Whoopee,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice

That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes

He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks

Another year, maybe less

She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

Yeah, she sits alone
Most every night

How Sweet It Is To Be In Love,Johnny Hartman,Jazz,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you"
Keeper Of The Flame,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I'm the keeper of the flame
My torch of love lights his name
Ask no pity, beg my shame
I'm the keeper of the flame

Played with fire and I was burn
Gave a heart but I was spurn
All these time I have yearned
Just to have my love return

Years have passed by
The spark still remains
True love can't die
It smoulders in flame
When the fire is burning off
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
I'm the keeper of the flame

Years have passed by

Dying love will leave no doubt

You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

Hmmm-nothing seems to matter
Hmmm-here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps morning higher
When I look at you
I cann't keep still
You're my thrill"

Strange Fruit,Nina Simone,Jazz,"Lewis Allen, Sonny White 

Southern trees
Bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop

As sung by Billie Holiday

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter cry."

She Wears Black,Incognito,Jazz,"(G. Harvey, R. Hope-Taylor, J.P. Maunick) 

 Instrumental"
The Copenhagen Cavern,Kari Bremnes,Jazz,"We'd been walking so far,
Where the houses lean together,
On cobblestones not made for my high heels.
As we drifted along,
Slowed down by the weather,
No need to talk
About the way that summer feels.

We went into a doorway
To a run-down bar beneath the ground,
To a place that the sun has never been.

Coming in from the day
To the darkness and the shadows,
The feeble lights could not dispel the gloom.
Slowly making our way,
We found an empty table.
The winter seemed to live inside this room.

This Copenhagen cavern:
A run-down bar beneath the ground,
A place that the sun has never seen.

Like a frail figurine,
She walked between the tables
With a vacant look and thinly braided hair.
She was all of sixteen,
Straight from a Dickens fable,
She was pleading for some money
For her fare.

The Copenhagen waiter
Wanted her back on the street,
But some impulse
Made us offer her a chair.

As I started to speak
I sensed a strong emotion.
She said I am from northern Norway, too,
She had come for a week,
A journey with her school friends
But a year had passed her by
Before she knew.

She said: I come from Senja,
A village on the outer coast,
But the climate here
Affected me much more.

Walking into the lane,
Looking back in through the window,
The light of day now seemed a little strange.
Would she leave for the train,
Would she stay another winter?
She moved betweeen the tables
Begging chance.

We'd been walking so far
Through cobblestone back alleys
No need to talk about
The way that summer feels."
Baby Don't You Quit Now,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"What you do to me
You get through to me
With a beautiful vibration
That is new to me
And instead of no
What comes out is, Oh
Baby, baby, don't you quit now

When tomorrow lips
Meet two coral lips
Then they kiss me, now and later
We can quarrel lips

I should turn you off
But you turn me on
So baby, baby don't you quit now

Every kiss I take
Is a piece of cake
And to give me a sample
Was your first mistake
'Cause I know when a little tastes like more
And now I want the whole darn
Bakery store

Take my pay from me
Christmas day from
Go anywhere you want
Except away from me
Quit tomorrow noon
Or nine o'clock
The fifth of June
But baby, don't you quit now

I should turn you off
But you turn me on
Baby, baby don't you quit now

Aha ha ha ha ha
La dee da da da dee da da

Quit tomorrow noon
Or at nine o'clock
The fifth of June
But baby, don't quit now"
Summer Breeze,Wayman Tisdale,Jazz,"You've been like a summer breeze

Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine"
Leaving Again/In The Wee Small Hours,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"Sleeping, waking, crying, leaving again
It's morning I have to go
Though every night pretends
Begins in quiet hoping that it never ends

They're always ending again
Breaking another dream
A dream where we could breathe
In the heavy curtained Prairie air of summer night

Watching lightning over wheat fields
Through a bedroom window
And the prairie gently rose up
With a feeling and embraced us

And when morning found us
I pulled you to me and promised to stay
But that was the night and now day

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never ever think of counting sheep

And when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
For in the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all"
Stormy Weather,Ethel Waters,Jazz,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

I walk around
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time"
Remember,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
But soon the May-time turned to December
You had forgotten; do you remember?"
Grandma's Hands,Al Jarreau,Jazz,"Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say: Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her
Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say"" Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn' drop no apple core
But I don't have Grandma anymore

If I get to Heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands"
This Is Always,Roberta Gambarini,Jazz,"Our love will live
Our love will last
This is not a dream
That ended with the dawn
It's one that fate intended
To go on and on

This isn't sometimes
This is always
This isn't maybe
This is always
This is love
The real beginning of forever

This isn't just
Midsummer madness
A passing glow
A moment's gladness
Yes, this is love
I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string
Around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that
This is always

This is always
This is always

This is always
This is always

You tied a string
Around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know
That this is always"
You Bring New Stars,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Dear Angels We have not spoken for a while
I don't know if I do this right
God knows I have forgotten what I knew
I don't know any longer what is true

So I ask and stay still

Bring me new stars in my heaven
Show me where the sun's at night

Dear Angels as I lay still I find you here
You speak so softly but not to my ears
Dear Angels is it me who called you first
Or is my calling, the answer to your care

I know as I'm still

You bring new stars
To my heaven
You show me where the sun's at night

You place new stars in my heaven
You show me where the sun's at night

You are here to see me through to you
You place new stars in my heaven
You take me to the sun at night

You place new stars in my heaven
You take me to the sun at night"
Lonely House (Stereo),June Christy,Jazz,"At night when everything is quiet
This old house seems to breathe a sigh
Sometimes I hear a neighbor snoring
Sometimes I can hear a baby cry

Sometimes I can hear a staircase creaking
Sometimes a distant telephone
Oh, and when the night settles down again
This old house and I are all alone

Lonely house, lonely me
Funny with so many neighbors
How lonesome you can be

Lonely town, lonely street
Funny, you can be so lonely
With all these folks around

I guess there must be something
I don't comprehend
Sparrows have companions
Even stray dogs have a friend

The night for me is not romantic
Unhook the stars and take them down
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house

The night, the night for me is not romantic
Unhook the stars and take them down
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house
At night when everything is quiet"
Because Of You,Sammy Davis Jr,Jazz,"Because of you there's a song in my heart
Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever and never to part

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile
Because of you

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile
Because of you"
Stardust,Hoagy Carmichael,Jazz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that were apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust
Of yesterday
The music
Of the years
Gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you.
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
But that was long ago, and now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew.
Though I dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain."
Mr Sandman,The Puppini Sisters,Jazz,"Mr. Sandman

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream (bung, bung, bung, bung)
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen (bung, bung, bung, bung)
Give him two lips like roses and clover (bung, bung, bung, bung)

Would be so peachy before we're too old
So please turn on your magic beam

When I Get Over You,Randy Crawford,Jazz,"Everybody sees some changes
Everybody sheds a skin or two
You won't recognize me
When I get over you

Unattended dreams will breathe life
All my wishes will come true
And there'll be time for everything
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

I'm setting free the monkey
I'm setting free the lions too
Yesterday's child will grow up wild
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

I'll be wearing a fairy-tale
I'll walk in glass high-heeled shoes
And there'll be a moral to the story
When I get over you

I'll be the life of the party
I'll misbehave and act the fool
I won't care who knows me
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

When I get over you
Yeah
The skies will still be blue
I said I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you..."
Deep Waters,Incognito,Jazz,"Deep Waters

It is a crime for me to be feeling this way
I'm going out of my mind and there's chang from a runaway love

Is it a dream (is it a dream)
That I'm throwing in the wishing well.
I'm losing control body and soul
Standing here waiting for a train that may never come

I saw the signs I read the book I should of had a second look
But boy you caught me dreaming
And there were times you'd come around and we agreed to just be friends
Tell me who was foolin who.

Deep waters I'm drowning deep waters slowly drowning deeper (repeat once)

What do I say (what can I say)
When words have failed me before
What do I do when I'm feeling so blue
And there's no place for me to run and hide.

I saw the sun inside your smile and wished for more than just a while
'Cause boy you caught me dreaming
A giant step into the dark we threw caution to the wind
Tell me who was fooling who.

MMMM I'm drownin

Deeper deeper deeper I'm drowning deeper

Oh I saw the signs I read the book I should have had a second look
'Cause boy you caught me dreamin'
And there are times you come around and we'd agreed to just be friends
Tell me who was really foolin who"

My baby understands now I got my Porgy
I'm through with bymays his way is may way forever more
Lord when I feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
So I'm changing my style my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man got my Porgy now

Underneath my finger tips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah

Just tricklin' off o' my lips

And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory

So come what may, I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years, day by day"

And though I close my eyes I see la vie en rose

And when you speak angels sing from above
Everyday words seems, to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be la vie en rose"

We've come this far by grace
And when you pray to find your place
Love will lead the way

In the shadows of the valley
Tears mingle with rain
A shining light will break my darkness
And mercy will remain

Bless the seven souls who raised me
Back in Georgia state
And tell my loved ones not to worry
My love will conquer hate

We've come this far by grace
And when you pray to find your place
Love will lead the way"

Sweet Nothing,Working Week,Jazz,"There ain't no such thing
As a free lunch my friend,
You've always got to pay,
When they stand there
In your way.
And there ain't no such thing
As a rich man's charity,
You've got to understand,
When he gives
That helping hand,
That there ain't no such thing
As a cut price ambition.
It's sweet nothing,
You're left with
Nothing at all.

There's no easy road
To a new life my friend,
Sometimes you face the pain,
Pick yourself up, start again.
But the love that you find
In the darkness of the night,
You can take it in your arms,
Feel it in your heart.
If you hold it and trust it,
It'll cost you the price of
Sweet nothing.
Sweet nothing.
You're left with nothing
Gotta find a friend,
With you to the end,
More than just a trend,
That won't leave you
On the shelf.
Gotta realise,
What you've got inside,
Better than a lie,
Help you have faith
In yourself.
Living on the line,
Gotta grab the time,
Now that you will find,
It's more than
Fame and wealth.
And hoping and loving
Can cost you the price of
Sweet nothing.
Boy, have faith in yourself,
Boy, believe in yourself,
Don't let them take
Your freedom,
It's with you till the end.
Believe in yourself."

Till I make you happy, too"

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

In Love In Vain,Nina Simone,Jazz,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the house and weep your heart out
And cry your eyes out and rack your brain

Could 'cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven, but I'm only up a tree
'Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain"
Isn't This a Lovely Day?,Fred Astaire,Jazz,"The weather is frightening, the thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day

The turn in the weather will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day
And everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke, and oh, what a break for me

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter-patter but it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day"
You and I,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"Poet and musician sing the same old tune
To the sweethearts that come and go
Let your intuition aided by the moon
Tell you little things the poet doesn't know

Darling, you and I know the reason why a summer sky is blue
And we know why birds in the trees sing melodies too
And why love will grow from the first ""hello"" until the last ""goodbye""
So to sweet romance, there is just one answer, you and I

Darling, you and I know the reason why a summer sky is blue
And we know why birds in the trees sing melodies too
And why love will grow from the first ""hello"" until the last ""goodbye""
So to sweet romance, there is just one answer, you and I"
It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),Duke Ellington & His Orchestra,Jazz,"What good is melody?
What good is music?
If it ain't possessing something sweet

It ain't the melody
It ain't the music
There's something else that makes this song complete

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Well it don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev-ry-thing you got YES

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing

It don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing boy

I said it don't mean a thing and all you got to do is sing

Now it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev-ry-thing you got Oh
It don't mean a thing boy, if it ain't got-a-that-a-swinga

Show me"
Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe,Abbey Lincoln,Jazz,"It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He got a smile that make the lilac wanna grow
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
Soon he kiss me and its Christmas everywhere
Trouble fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? that's all I has to know
Seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe

It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He got a smile that make the lilac wanna grow
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
Soon he kiss me and its Christmas everywhere
Trouble fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? that's all I has to know
Seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe

Some Kind Of Wonderful,Peter Cincotti,Jazz,"(Music & Lyrics by Gerald Goffin & Carole King)

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me that you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Anytime my little world turns blue
I just have to look at you
Everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Oh wonderful, some kind of wonderful"
If I Were A Bell,Blossom Dearie,Jazz,"Ask me how do I feel now that we're cozy and clinging
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light or if I were a banner I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a gate I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs
Well and if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong, ding

Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson I'm leaning
Well sir, all I can say if I were a bridge I'd be burning
Yes, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack or if I were a goose I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel, now that we're finally caressing
Pal, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Yes or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong, ding

Ask me how do I feel, now that we're cozy and clinging
Well, sir, all I can say is if I were a bell I'd be ringing
From the moment we kissed tonight"
Jersey Girl,Holly Cole,Jazz,"Got no time for the corner boys

Don't want no whores on 8th Avenue

Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival

Darn That Dream,Miles Davis,Jazz,"Darn that dream

Then I tumble out of paradise

I'm Puttin' All My Eggs In One Basket,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"I've been a roaming Romeo
My Juliets have been many
But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on:

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you

I'm giving all my love to one baby

I've got a great big amount
Saved up in my love account
Honey
And I've decided
Love divided
In two
Won't do

So
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

I've tried to love more than one

When I try to
Be true
To two

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you"
Stronger,Room Eleven,Jazz,"Black days
The shower is still at the height you left it
I haven't moved
And the room is only getting bigger
Time chews on my bones
Got to get out of here
I'm meant for more important things

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day

I brush the words off my tongue
But the stories still remain
They keep reminding me
Show the road behind me
And cut the map of my dreams into pieces
Can't find the crossroad where it all went wrong
Where it all went wrong

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day

I've got memories
They are a remedy
And a few evil thoughts
I still got your key
I save my energy
I'll be stronger than be before
I'll get up and open some new doors

I'm getting stronger every day
But that's easy 'cause I've never been this weak
I'm getting stronger every day, every day"
Precious Years,Matt Dusk,Jazz,"(Robin Smith / Mark Niedzwiedz)

When love is young
The tallest tree
Is there to climb
Is evergreen
In summer fields we dream our dreams
When love is young

When love is young
The air is sweet
Forbidden fruit is all we eat
An august moon is your conceit
When love is young

These are precious years
Such intoxicating years
When our innocence slowly comes undone
Hearts are spilt on purest silk
When love is young

instrumental

These are precious years
Such intoxicating years
When our innocence slowly comes undone
Hearts are spilt on purest silk
When love is young

When love is young
The glass is full
No empty chairs, no silent walls
Like warriors, we conquer all
When love is young

These are precious years
Such intoxicating years
When our innocence slowly comes undone
Hearts are spilt on purest silk
These precious years
These precious years
Never will grow old
They are forever gold"
What Are You Doing The  Rest Of Your Life?,Maysa,Jazz,"What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and south and east and west of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of gold and forest overnight
And when you stand before the candles on the cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love you keep in your eyes
I'll awake and rest asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two 

And you are my life
Summer, winter, spring, and fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you

All I ask with you
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you
Is all of my life with you

All I ask with you
With you"
Mr. Tru Love,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Mr. Tru Love,
Dancin' and beaming on my blurry sky.
You're like moonglow
And right by my window you came to hide.

Mr Tru Love,
Trading my teardrops for a smile.
Can I let you go,
And get back to loneliness for a little while?

'Cause I've been waiting so long for someone like you,
And now that you're here I'm so helpless and hazy with you.

Oh, Mr Tru Love,
Always enchanting my weary eye.
Don'tell me even if you know: when you strike like thunder, do you always have to die?

'Cause I've been waiting so long for someone like you,
And now that you're here I'm so helpless and hazy with you.

'Cause I've been waiting so long for someone like you,
And now that you're here I'm so helpless and hazy with you."

Some Lessons,Melody Gardot,Jazz,"Well I'm buckled up inside
It's a miracle that I'm alive
I do not think I can survive
On bread and wine alone
To think that I could have fallen
A centimeter to the left
Would not be here to see the sunset
Or have myself a time
Well why do the hands of time
So easily unwind
Some lessons we learn the hard way
Some lessons don't come easy
That's the price we have to pay
Some lessons we learn the hard way
They don't come right off and right easy
That's why they say some lessons learned we learn the hard way

Remember the sound of the pavement
World turned upside down
City streets unlined and empty
Not a soul around
Life goes away in a flash
Right before your eyes
If I think real hard well I reckon
I've had some real good times
Well why do the hands of time
So easily unwind
Some lessons we learn the hard way
Some lessons don't come easy
That's the price we have to pay
Some lessons we learn the hard way
They don't come right off and right easy
That's why they say some lessons learned we learn the hard way"
Born to Sail Away,Chiara Civello,Jazz,"Only child of moon and sun
She learned to love the space between each one.
Lots of freedom, lots of room so she could bloom.

The braces taught her how to smile
She wasn't shy but laughing took a while.
All her teachers were surprised
She wanted first to fall and then to rise.

She was born to sail away...
She was born to sail away...

On a shore of crooked stripes
She wondered where all the stars had gone to
Till she found them in his eyes, the perfect love she could grow in... in two.

But she was born to sail away...
She was born to sail away.

Wind blows and time flies by her
She knows she's goin' somewhere
Wind blows and time flies by her
She knows she's goin' somewhere...

But she was born to sail away...
She was born to sail away...
Born to sail away
She was born to sail away."
Sweet Lorraine,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"I've just found joy
I'm as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When I'm with my sweet Lorraine

A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer skies
When you see her you will realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

Now when it's raining I don't miss the sun
'Cause its in my baby's smile
And to think that I'm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
I can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine"
Return To Paradise,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"Come my love with me

Come with me and find
Your peace of mind,
Return to paradise!

Velvet moon above,
Evil turns to love,
Love evermore!

Come with me and find
Your peace of mind,
Return to paradise!"
Lullaby Of Birdland,Sarah Vaughan,Jazz,"Lullaby of birdland
That's what I
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase, how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtledoves
Bill and coo
When they love
That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weapy 'ol willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'll cry on my pillow
If you should tell me
Farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland
Whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland,
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love"

Phrase you thought never would phase you
Well baby, you better hold on tight
'Cause I'm the one who's supposed to
Kneel down and propose, well all right

Just sleep tight with the thought that you'll
Always be caught up in love with me

Have the answer of whether we'll be
Or whether we won't be
In love...

Streets Of Philadelphia,Molly Johnson,Jazz,"I was bruised and battered
And I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window 
I didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me
Wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue 
Till my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends 
Vanished and gone
At night I could hear the
Blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia"

But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on

Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone"
way back,Jazzamor,Jazz,"1
No looking back
Face the facts you said
Fait accompli (it's over)
Get out of my face
I prayed

Remembering the old schoolyard
Cheek to cheek and heart to heart
You and me so crazy
Really thrilled to bits

We've been young and we've been free
Been having confidence in love and honesty

Hey babe
The simple things and time were on our side
Way back when love was on your mind
Was on your mind

2
Friday night we made grade
Dressed to kill couldn't hardly wait
In the early morning rain
We've been searching for a place to stay
The old oak gave us shelter then you took my breath away

We've been young and we've been free
Been having confidence in love and honesty

Hey babe
The simple things and time were on our side
Way back when love was on your mind
Was on your mind"
In The Still Of The Night,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window 
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
The times without number
Darling that I say to you

Do you love me 
As I love you
Are you my life to be
My dream come true
Or will that dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night"
Rockin' Chair,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies round this rockin' chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rockin' chair gets it, Judgement Day is here
Chained to my rockin' chair

Old rockin' chair's got me, son, (Rocking chair got you, father)
My cane by my side, (Yes, your cane by your side)
Now fetch me a little gin, son (Ain't got no gin, father)

Just sittin' me here grabbin' (Grabbin')
At the flies round this old rockin' chair (Rockin' chair)

Chained to my rockin', old rockin' chair"
I Cried For You,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I've found two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
I've found a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me"
The Waking,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.
I learn by going where I have to go.

We think by feeling. What is there to know?
I hear my being dance from ear to ear.
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.

Of those so close beside me, which are you?
God bless the Ground! I shall walk softly there,
And learn by going where I have to go.

Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?

The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.

Great Nature has another thing to do
To you and me, so take the lively air,
And, lovely, learn by going where to go.

This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.
What falls away is always. And is near.
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I learn by going where I have to go."
It's Not Unusual,Willie Bobo,Jazz,"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
Oh I wanna' die
It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day no matter what you say
You find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find out that I'm in love with you
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh"
I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,Steve Tyrell,Jazz,"I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad when I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose needs the sun and the rain
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
Baby if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back I will be around, just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do
I don't know what else to do"
Walk Like An Egyptian,The Puppini Sisters,Jazz,"All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick, oh, whey, oh
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles, oh, whey, oh
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Walk like an Egyptian

The blond waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves, oh, whey, oh
You drop your drink then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings, oh, whey, oh
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm then you pull it back
Life is hard you know, oh, whey, oh
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance, oh, whey, oh
They spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the cops in the donut shop say
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Ay, oh, whey, oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian"
Forty-Second Street,The Boswell Sisters,Jazz,"Come and meet
Those dancing feet
On the avenue I'm taking you to
Forty-Second Street

Hear the beat
Of dancing feet
It's the song I love the melody of

Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet

Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite

Strange Fruit,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant South
The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop"
Sukiyaki,Tuck & Patti,Jazz,"It's all because of you
I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away
Now my life is just a rainy day and I love you so
How much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely.

Untouchable memories
Keep on haunting me
Another love so true
That once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Oh I can't stop this love that I have for you
Now that you are gone I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine
Once again you'll be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
You took your love away from me.

Oh I can't stop this love that I have for you
Now that you are gone I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine
Once again you'll be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
You took your love away from me.

Oh, you took your love
You took it away from me.
Oh, I know in reality, you and I will never be
You took your love away from me.

Me, I wish the sun would shine
And once again you'll be mine all mine
Oh, but in reality, you and I will never be
Oh, you and I will never be

I look up where I go
So the tears won't fall
I look up where I go
So the tears won't fall

Up On The Roof,Peter Cincotti,Jazz,"(Music & Lyrics by Gerald Goffin & Carole King)

When this old world starts a getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get away from the hustling crowd
And all the rat-race noise down in the street

On the roof, the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so

At night the stars put on a show for free
Darling, you can share it all with me

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's troubleproof
If this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof
Up on the roof"
Good Morning Heartache,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Good morning, heartache, you ole gloomy sight
Good morning, heartache, thought we'd said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you
But you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning, heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin' around
Good morning, heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin' around
Good morning, heartache, sit down"
More Than You Know,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I've found you on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But darling, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry
How I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I show
More than you'll ever know"
Afro-Blue,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Dream of a land my soul is from
I hear a hand stroke on a drum
Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers are face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away
To some secluded place
Whispering trees echo their sighs
Passionate pleas, tender replies

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers in flight
Upward they climb
Burst at the height
Slowly subside
My slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it's not a dream
The two are you and me

Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue"
Blue Rose,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Blue as the crying sky
With no thorn, and no thistle
Only an open face
Staring at the waking world

Maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

Her arms stretch wide
To receive life
And her roots go deep into the black earth for strength
And she blooms

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine

She blooms while the people sleep
Only the travelers see her
To those who rise with the noon day sun
She is a closed mystery

And maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Oh, maybe she's just a morning glory
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine
Lost in a tangle of vine"
Be-Bop Santa Claus,Babs Gonzales,Jazz,"Twas the blight before christmas
And all through the dawn
The scene was quiet except pop and mom
There sat hung in their big easy chair
Goofed on egg nog sherry and beer
Ces and lil jr, lie there in the bed
Whle visions of cadillacs jumped in their head
Moms jumped up and said pops lets quit it to bed
Then out on the stoop oweee such a clatter
Pops fled to the porthole to see what was the matter
He did a jump and fell back"

The Creator Has A Master Plan (Peace),Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"There was a time, when peace was on the earth,
And joy and happiness did reign and each man knew his worth
In my heart how I yearn for that spirit's return
And I cry, as time flies,
Om, Om

There is a place where love forever shines
And rainbows are the shadows of a presence so divine
And the glow of that love lights the heavens above
And it's free, can't you see, come with me

The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness for every man
The creator has a working plan
Peace and happiness for every man
The creator makes but one demand
Happiness through all the land"
Where Love Shines,Incognito,Jazz,"(J.P. Maunick / S. Grey)

People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
Everyday people looking for love
Yes they are searching

There's nothing in the world
Nothing else to be found, that can compare
With the power of love
Everyday we are yearning

Now gather together
>From every corner of the world
Let's open our minds to the light

People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me
It's no mystery

Let it rain on me, yeah

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
So much anger and pain, life's a game
That we're losing

Stop the masquerade
By the truth we are bound, and that's no lie
People crying for change
Everyday they are praying

Now gather together
>From every corner of the world
Let's open our minds to the light

Your love
Really wanna have it
Do you really dig it?
Really gotta get, get, get, get it"
Prayer Dance (Live),Rachelle Ferrell,Jazz,"Lift my knees from the ground
I will put my feet down
I will dance all my prayers

With a swing and a sway
I will do it my way

Unto God

Do I stand for peace and love?
Yes I will... express myself to God in my dance
And when I pray I feel rhythm and song
That's why I dance all my prayers
Unto God"
Someone to watch over me,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me"

When I Fall In Love,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"When I fall in love it will be forever 
Or I'll never fall in love 
In a restless world like this is 
Love is ended before it's begun 
And too many moonlight kisses 
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely 
Or I'll never give my heart 
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I fall in love with you.

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I'll fall in love with you"
Do It Again,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"You really shouldn't have done it
You hadn't any right
I really shouldn't have let you
Kiss me
And although it was wrong
I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it
And you know you shouldn't have done it

Oh.
Do it again
I may say no, no, no, no, no
But do it again
My lips just ache
To have you take the kiss
That's waiting for you
You know if you do
You won't regret it
Come and get it.

Oh
No one is near
I may cry oh. Oh. oh. oh. oh.
But no one can hear.
Mamma may scold me
'Cause she told me
It was naughty but then

Please
Do it again
Yes do it again And again and again and again and again and again

And hold me close
In your arms
All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say
Goodbye and amen.

But until then
Please do it again"
I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"The snow is snowin'
The wind is blowin'

What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm"
Stranger In Paradise,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"Take my hand, 
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed, 
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside 
An angel like you
I saw your face, 
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended 
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms 
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"

It's About Time,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"Walking down to the water's edge
Where I have been before
If I don't find my love sometime
I'm walking out that door
Some may come and some may go
But no one seems to be
The person I've been searching for
The one who's meant for me

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely
Looking for her, my love my one and only
Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way
So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

When I'm making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cause it's about time

You try too hard and it feels just like
You're running on thin air
Why does luck happen by surprise
If you don't really care
The past is gone the flames are out
From fires that have burned
New ideals and different thoughts
From lessons I have learned

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely
Looking for her, my love my one and only
Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way
So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day
When I'm making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cause it's about time

Got the feeling this could take a pretty long while
To find that smile
Put my faith in another piece of good advice
Well I tried that twice
Waiting for, a little something more
To inspire, take me higher
And I'm ready to make someone mine
Making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'll find her, 'cause it's about time
It's about time"
Love For Sale,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work

The More I See You,Eliane Elias,Jazz,"The more I see you the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

The more I see you the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
The more I see you as years go by

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
The more I see you as years go by

The more I see you the more I want you
The more I see you the more I want you
The more I see you the more I want you"
My Broken Heart,Celso Fonseca,Jazz,"Alone under the stars
Along with my guitar
I'm about to give
All that love can take from you
My broken heart

Don't tell too many lies
Don't blame the moon
And please don't cry
I'm about to take
All that love can give steal from you
My broken heart

I only see blue moons
When I should see your eyes
It's for you the song
From my broken heart, I sing along
Under the stars

Doo dee, doo doo ...

I only see blue moons
When I should see your eyes
It's for you the song
From my broken heart, I sing along
Under the stars"
My Funny Valentine,Chet Baker,Jazz,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day"
I Love Being Here With You,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I love the East, I love the West
North and South, they're both the best
But I only want go there as a guest
'Cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more
You and they never be a bore
'Cause I love being here with you

Singing in the shower
Laughing by the hour
Life is such a breezy game
I love all kinds of weather
As long as we're together
Oh I love to hear you say my name

I love good wine, fine cuisine
Candle light I love the scene
Cause baby if you know just what I mean
I love being here with you

I love Ella singing, Basie's band is swinging
Cause that's something else you know
They know how to play it, they know how to say it
They just wind it up and let it go

Cary Grant through
Two time beggars but his charm just takes me away
But don't get me wrong how do you say
I love being here with you"
Serenity,Steve Cole,Jazz,"As I sit here and slowly close my eyes
I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my body
I'm the one in your soul
Reflecting inner light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner child

I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Tragic visions slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my time


I'm the one who loves you
No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner child

I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

I need serenity [x2]"
I Can't Give You Anything But Love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Scheme a while dream a while 
You're sure to find
Happiness and I guess

All those things you always pine for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworths doesn't sell, baby
Until that lucky day
You know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love"
Straighten Up And Fly Right,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air,
The monkey thought that everything 
Was on the square.
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey 
Off his back,
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, 
""Now listen, Jack..."" 

Straighten up and fly right,
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.
Ain't no use in divin',
What's the use in jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.

The buzzard told the monkey, 
You are chokin' me.
Release your hold and I'll set you free.
The monkey looked the buzzard right 
Dead in the eye and said,
Your story's so touching, but it sounds 
Just like a lie.

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.

Ain't no use in divin'
Ain't no good in jivin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow - your - top.

Fly right!"
I Will Be Blessed,Lisa Ekdahl,Jazz,"If the sun
Refused to shine
Down on me
Till the end of time
As long as I have your caress
Your tenderness
I will be blessed

If the stars
Refused their light
Just for me
They stayed out of sight
If you say you love me best
I won't care less
I will be blessed

If the wind won't blow your name
Until I'm still
I will
If it's whispered from above
The highest hill
I will

If the moon
Up in the sky
Turned its face
From the lonely eye
I could never be distressed
Or love you less
I will be blessed"
A Blossom Fell,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
The gypsies say and I know why
""A falling blossom only touches lips that lie.""

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied"
Broken,Norah Jones,Jazz,"He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile
Guess he's been that way for quite a while
Got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim
Did he do it to himself or was it done to him?

People say that he don't look well
But all he needs from what I can tell
Is someone to help wash away all the paint
From his purple hands before it gets too late

I saw him stand alone
Under a broken street light
So sincere ... singing silent night
But the trees were full
And the grass was green
It was the sweetest thing I had ever seen

He may move slow
But that don't mean he's going nowhere
He may be moving slow
But that don't mean he's going nowhere"

Come Dance With Me,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots
And come dance with me
Come dance with me, what an evenin' for some terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place
Come on, dance with me

Romance with me cross a crowded floor
And while the rhythm swings
What lovely things I'll be sayin'
'Cause what is dancin' but makin' love
Set to music... Playin'

When the band begins to leave the stand
Folks start to roam
As we waltz home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me"
When The Saints Go Marching In,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"We are trav'ling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

O when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

O when the trumpet sounds the call
O when the trumpet sounds the call
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
O Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in"
A Beautiful Friendship,Susannah McCorkle,Jazz,"This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
It ended a moment ago.
This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
I know,
For your eyes told me so.

We were always
Like sister and brother,
Until tonight,
When we looked at each other.

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of lov&101

(Instrumental interlude)

We were always
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love

That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love.

That was the end of a beautiful friendship,
And just the beginning of love!"

It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),The Mills Brothers,Jazz,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It makes no diff'rence
If it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm
Ev'rything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing

Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)"
Easy Street,Julie London,Jazz,"Easy street, I'd love to live on easy street
Nobody works on easy street
Just lie around all day, just sit and play the horses

Life is sweet for folks who live on easy street
No weekly payments you must meet
That makes your hair turn gray

When opportunity comes knockin'
You just keep on with your rockin'
'Cause you know your fortune's made

And if the sun makes you perspire
There's a man that you can hire
To plant trees so you can have shade

On easy street, I'm telling everyone I meet
If I could live on easy street I'd want no job today
So please, go 'way"
When I Look In Your Eyes,Diana Krall,Jazz,"When I look in your eyes, I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes 
I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes 
When I look in your eyes 

And it is no surprise, to see the softness of the moon in your eyes 
The gentle sparkle of the stars in your eyes 
When I look in your eyes 

In your eyes, I see the deepness of the sea 
I see the deepness of the love 
The love I feel you feel for me 

Autumn comes, summer dies 
I see the passing of the years in your eyes 
And when we part there will be no tears no goodbyes 
I'll just look into your eyes 

Those eyes, so wise 
So warm, so real 
How I love the world, your eyes reveal"
Nightmoves,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"The music begins and the tidals fade in
Starring you and me
The hero is struggling to say, that his lady is far away
In her prison of wishes

We're loving, we fight but it's all day for night
Just to masquerade
We're reel till the red light is off, then we go, take our faces off
Like two clowns in a side show

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Just another Technicolor, role man's on the screen
Love is like two dreamers dreaming the same dream
Just another Technicolor, romance, romance on the screen

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Just another Technicolor, romance on the screen

I keep you in frame and I whisper your name
Till the picture fades
The feeling is already gone, I don't know why I'm going on
Can't remember the ending

Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Love is like two dreamers
Love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream
Love is like, love is like two dreamers dreaming the exact same dream"
Don't Make Me Wait For Love,Kenny G,Jazz,"Sitting here, just staring at your picture
Waiting for your call
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion
We could have it all

Time and time again you tell me to be patient
But we can't let love slip away

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Ooh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Hmm, I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness
Fall asleep alone
Give me a sign, a man ain't supposed to face life
Standing on his own

When you're near me, I can't help but see forever
Come and rescue me tonight

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Can't you see I need your love? I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, yeah
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Oh, oh, oh, baby, don't make me wait for love this time, oh
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find
Can't you see I need your love? I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time
Oh, oh, darlin' a love like this is hard to find, ooh, baby
Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, I need you, baby
I love you, I need you, I want you, baby"
Alison,Holly Cole,Jazz,"Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, now
The way you look I understand
That you were not impressed
I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you've were loving some body
I only know it isn't mine
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Alison, my aim is true

I see you've got a husband now
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand
I'll bet he took all that he could take
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way

Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true
My aim is true"

Russian Lullaby,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Where the dreamy Volga flows
There's a lonely Russian Rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
Listen

Ev'ry night you'll hear her croon
A Russian lullaby


Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry

Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

A land that's free for you and me
And a Russian lullaby"
I Wished On The Moon,Cassandra Wilson,Jazz,"Every night was long and gloomy, shadows gathered in the air
No one ever listened to me, no one wondered did I care
None in all the world to love me, none to count that stars that hung
Then the moon came out above me and I saw that it was young

I wished on the moon for something I never knew
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April day that would not dance away

I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two
Wished on a star and asked for a dream or two
I looked for ev'ry loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you"
Street Life,The Crusaders,Jazz,"I still hang around neither lost nor found
Hear the lonely sound of music in the night
Nights are always bright
That's all that's left for me, yeah
I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only way I know
Street life
And there's a thousand cards to play
Until you play your life away
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are
Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel, for a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep t young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon
Street life, street life, street life, oh street life..."
I've got a crush on you,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Hmm I've got a crush on someone. Guess who
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All day and night time give me sign
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush my baby on you

How glad the million ralish from millionairs to carish
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you"
My One and Only Love,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all of your splendor
My one and only love

Shadow's fall and spreads their mystique charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender, yes
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
Blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tell me that you in my own [Incomprehensible]

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender, babe
My one and only love

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender, babe
My one and only love yes

My one and my only love"
Two Sleepy People,Fats Waller,Jazz,"Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning, look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
Too much in love to say, ""Goodnight""

Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
Much, too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all, but I was crazy about you baby
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are, just about the same
Foggy little fella, dizzy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
Much, too much in love to say, ""Goodnight""
Goodnight"
Mixtape,Jamie Cullum,Jazz,"Everything I know is you
Let me tell you what we're listening to
I'm a gentle soul I'm sure
But on the stereo I'm a dictator
Do you even have a tape machine?
To facilitate my plastic dreams
All the things that I have seen, from
Morrissey to John Coltrane Ah!...
Cinematic Orchestra, De La Soul the Shangri-La's
An adolescent love letter, a sparkling jewel of manual labour

I'll make you a mixtape that's a blueprint of my soul
It may sound grand but babe it's all you need to know
I'll make you a mixtape that will charm you into bed
It details everything that's running round my head

That's running round my head

Fondling, record and play
Without you it's records night and day

This ain't no disc of MP3's
This one' handmade, fashioned lovingly

Plant the rhythm in your bones
You're the only angel in headphones
My love can paint a million tones
From Nine Inch Nails to Louis Armstrong
So resurrect your stereo
And the swathrs of melodies will flow
Thelonious, Maurizio
I tell you babe it will make my heart glow

I'll make you mixtape that's a blueprint of my soul
It may sound grand but babe it's all you need to know
I'll make you a mixtape that will charm you into bed
It details everything that's running round my head"
Lady Sings The Blues,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Lady sing the blues,
She's got them bad,
She feels so sad.

And wants the world to know,
Just what her blues are all about,

Lady sings the blues,
She tells her side,
Nothing to hide.

Now the world will know,
Just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
When you get a bad start,
When you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
I know I won't die,
'Cause I love him

Lady sings the blues,
I'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad,
But now the world will know,
She's never gonna sing them no more.

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart,
When you get a bad start,
When you and your man have to part

Ain't gonna just sit around and cry,

Night And Day,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon AND under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And ITS torment won't be through
'TIL you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day"
Broken,Norah Jones,Jazz,"He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile

Lucky To Be Me,Blossom Dearie,Jazz,"What a day,
Fortune smiled and came my way,
Bringing love I never thought I'd see,
I'm so lucky to be me.
What a night,
Suddenly you came in sight,
Looking just the way I'd hoped you'd be,
I'm so lucky to be me.
I am simply thunderstruck
At the change in my luck:
Knew at once I wanted you,
Never dreamed you'd want me, too.
I'm so proud
You chose me from all the crowd,
There's no other guy I'd rather be,
I could laugh out loud,
I'm so lucky to be me."
I Will Survive,The Puppini Sisters,Jazz,"I Will Survive

First I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to carry on
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I
I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I will stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
Now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me"
Tranquil Flight,Beady Belle,Jazz,"Tell me a tale
And lull me to sleep
I'll walk into the vale
Of wonderland so deep

Let me escape
To gain upon my hope
And let me through the gate
Into the world of thought

Sleep inducing phrases in your lullaby
Tell me I am airborne, to fairyland I fly
Sit at my bedside just one more time
Stroke me down, give me peace of mind
Rock me till I'm leaving reality behind

Sleepy ideas
Is giving me a drive
My soothing fantasies
The reason I survive

Draw the Venetian blinds
And hide what hurts to see
We're running out of time
Defined by you and me"
He Loves And She Loves,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"He loves and she loves,
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love,
And that's what we both should do.

Oh I always knew someday you'd come along,
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?

Oh I always knew someday you'd come along,
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?
Won't you love me, as I love you?

Original Version:
Peter:
Now that I have found you
I must hang around you.
Though you may refuse me,
You will never lose me.
If the human race is
Full of happy faces -

Frankie:
It's because they all love
That wonderous thing they call love.

Peter:
He loves and she loves,
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?

Frankie:
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love,
And that's what we both should do.

Peter:
Oh I always knew someday you'd come along,

Frankie:
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
Hear me

Peter:
He loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?

Frankie:
Feel a funny feeling
In my heart a-stealing;
If it's love, I'm for it.
Gosh! How I adore it!
You're the silver lining
For which I've been pining.

Peter:
Lonesome days are over;
From now on, we're in clover.

Repeat refrain."
Cheek To Cheek,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek"
I Don't Know Enough About You,Diana Krall,Jazz,"I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you
Just when I think you're mine you try a different line
Baby what can I do

I read the latest news
No buttons on my shoes
Baby I'm confused about you
You've got me in a spin
And what a spin I'm in
'Cause I don't know enough about you

Jack of all trades
Master of none
And isn't it a shame
I'm so sure that you'de be good for me
If you'de only play my game

You know I went to school
And I'm nobody's fool
That is to say until I met you
I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you

Jack of all trades
Master of none
And isn't it a shame
I'm so sure that you'de be good for me
If you'de only play my game

You know I went to school
And I'm nobody's fool
That is to say until I met you
I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you

I know a bit about biology
A little more about psychology
I'm a little gem in geology
But I don't know enough about you
No, I don't know enough about you
No, I don't know enough about you"
Solitaire,Nina Simone,Jazz,"Carl Nutter, Renee Borek, King Guion 

Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,
Dealing out the cards from left to right,
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

And until you want to share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire."
You,Pieces Of A Dream,Jazz,"I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would
And baby it's you

The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
(You)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night
(You)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth

Next year let's call this day our anniversary
The day I put my heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on
Say that you'll always be mine
Cause girl whe I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mine
And baby it's you

The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile

The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours

I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,Les Brown,Jazz,Instrumental
Alfie,Trijntje Oosterhuis,Jazz,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?

Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel

And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in

I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie"
Moonlight Cocktail,Glenn Miller,Jazz,"Couple of jiggers of moonlight and add a star
Pour in the blue of a June night and one guitar
Mix in a couple of dreamers, and there you are
Lovers hail the Moonlight Cocktail

Now add a couple of flowers, a drop of dew
Stir for a couple of hours till dreams come true
And to the number of kisses, it's up to you
Moonlight Cocktail, need a  few

Cool it in the summer breeze
Serve it in the starlight underneath the trees
You'll discover tricks like these
Are sure to make your Moonlight Cocktail please

Follow the simple directions and they will bring
Life of another complexion where you'll be king
You will awake in the morning and start to sing
Moonlight Cocktails are the thing

(Follow the simple directions and they will bring)
(Life of another complexion where you'll be king)
You will awake in the morning and start to sing
Moonlight Cocktails are the thing"
Every Time She Whispers,Michael Franks,Jazz,"There isn't any part of me she does not know
We've been together about a thousand years or so
Still almost instantly my love begins to show
Every time she whispers

It makes no difference if I'm down upon my luck
When she invites me in, my gloom becomes unstuck
I feel the barriers around me deconstruct
Every time she whispers

Tensions dissolve when we touch
In her arms the world is erased when it's too much
All of my deep blue disappears
As soon as I hear her whisper

Passion evolves when we touch
In her arms I measure success counting how much
Music she composes in sighs
And how many times she whispers my name

She whispers my name

Love is the weakness that we need to make us strong
How can a hundred million Frenchmen all be wrong?
And I'm completely at the mercy of her song
Every time she whispers

Tensions dissolve when we touch
In her arms the world is erased when it's too much
All of my deep blue disappears
As soon as I hear her whisper

Passion evolves when we touch
In her arms I measure success counting how much
Music she composes in sighs
And how many times she whispers my name

Tensions dissolve when we touch
In her arms the world is erased when it's too much
All of my deep blue disappears
As soon as I hear her whisper

Passion evolves when we touch
In her arms I measure success counting how much
Music she composes in sighs
And how many times she whispers my name

She whispers my name

Inside
Every time she whispers
High tide
Cannot be tamed

Of course
Every time she whispers
Love force
Rages unchained

Inside
Every time she whispers
High tide
Cannot be tamed

Of course
Every time she whispers
Love force
Rages unchained"
It's a Sin To Tell a Lie,Fats Waller,Jazz,"Be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of heart have been broken
Just because these words were spoken

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie

Now, ya better be sure that it's true when you say ""I love ya.""
Honey chile, don'tcha know it's a sin to tell a lie? Whole lotta hearts have been
Broken. Ya know why they were broken? Just for these foolish little words that
Were spoken. Ya know what they were? ""I love ya, I love ya."" Darlin', ya know
Doggone well I LUV ya and if ya break my heart I've GOT to die. So ya better be
Sure that it's true when you come runnin' up here sayin' ""I love ya"" 'cause it's a sin
To tell a lie.

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie"
Gentle Rain,Astrud Gilberto,Jazz,"We both are lost and alone in the world
Walk with me in the gentle rain
Don't be afraid, I've a hand for your hand
And I will be your love for a while

I feel your tears, as they fall on my cheek
They are warm like the gentle rain
Come little one, you've got me in the world
And our love will be sweet, very sweet

Come little one, you've got me in the world
And our love will be sweet
Very sweet, very sad
Like the gentle rain
Like the gentle rain"
How High The Moon,Dianne Reeves,Jazz,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Until it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Until it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music

Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far

She's Funny That Way,Nat King Cole,Jazz,"I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see
Just glad I'm livin' and happy to be
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She'd never holler, she'd live in a tent
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

Though she'd love to work 
And slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off 
If I went away

But why should I leave her, why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

(Instrumental)

When I hurt her feelin's once in a while
Her only answer is one little smile
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way"
Here's To Life,Shirley Horn,Jazz,"No complaints
And no regrets
I still believe in chasing dreams
And placing bets
But I have learned
That all you give
Is all you get
So give it all you've got

I had my share
I drank my fill
And even though I'm satisfied
I'm hungry still
To see what's down another road
Beyond the hill
And do it all again

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Funny how the time just flies
How love can go
From warm hellos
To sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories
You've memorized
To keep your winters warm

For there's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings
Or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game
I want to play
For laughs
For life
For love

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
Here's to life
For dreamers and their dreams

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
Here's to life
Here's to love
Here's to you

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
Here's to life
Here's to love
Here's to you"
Blue Alert,Madeleine Peyroux,Jazz,"There's perfume burning in the air
Bits of beauty everywhere
Shrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt

She comes so close
You feel her then
She tells you No and No again
Your lip is cut on the edge of her pleated skirt
Blue Alert

Visions of her drawing near
Arise, abide, and disappear
You try to slow it down
It doesn't work

It's just another night I guess
All tangled up in nakedness
You even touch yourself
You're such a flirt
Blue Alert

You know how nights like this begin
The kind of knot your heart gets in
Any way you turn is going to hurt


There's perfume burning in the air
Bits of beauty everywhere
Shrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt
Blue Alert

She breaks the rules so you can see
She's wilder than you'll ever be
You talk religion but she won't convert

Her body's twenty stories high
You try to look away, you try
But all you want to do is get there first
Blue Alert

You know how nights like this begin
The kind of knot your heart gets in
Any way you turn is going to hurt

There's perfume burning in the air
Bits of beauty everywhere
Shrapnel flying, soldier hit the dirt
Blue Alert
Blue Alert..."
The Long Day Is Over,Norah Jones,Jazz,"Feeling tired
By the fire
The long day
Is over

Asleep at dawn
The embers
Burn on

With no reprise
The sun will rise

Is over"
Puttin' On The Ritz,Fred Astaire,Jazz,"Have you seen the well-to-do, up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare, with their noses in the air
High hats and Arrow collars, white spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime, for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits,
Puttin' on the ritz.

Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes
And cutaway coat, perfect fits,
Puttin' on the ritz.

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying mighty hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)

Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or ""umberellas"" in their mitts,
Puttin' on the ritz.

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits,
(Puttin' on the ritz)

Little Room,Norah Jones,Jazz,"You an' me and
Me and you
In my little room
There's room enough for us to do
The things we like to do

Oops, I hit my elbow on the doorknob
Its right there
It's by the bed next to my head
But I don't even care

There's stars up on the wall
And they all glow in the dark
And we can hear the children playing
Outside in the park

There's bars on the window
And if there were a fire
We'd burn up for sure
But that's just fine by me 'cause
We would be together ever more

In this little room
In the big city we're so far
From the people that we knew in
My big ol' blue car

But if we stick together
Then I know we'll be ok
'Cause when it gets too cold outside
This room is where we'll stay"
I'm Beginning To See the Light,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light"
Testify,Dianne Reeves,Jazz,"Sometimes you won't understand why life is the way it is
Things don't always go the way you plan them
But I believe, God and time are synonymous
And in time God reveals all things
Be still, stand in love, pay attention

I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify

When I look back on my life
I shudder when I think of the danger I put myself in
But amazing grace always carried me to safety
Knowing that I'd go back to the same place again and again
No one could ever love me, the way that you do
In spirit, mind and body I surrender myself daily to you

I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just gotta testify

So sweet the journey when you learn to love yourself, accept yourself
Forgive yourself, respect yourself, believe in yourself, be yourself
With amazing grace as your constant friend
I am free of anger, I am free of fear, and my mind is at ease
I don't regret yesterday, 'cause yesterday made me who I am today

I just wanna testify
I just wanna testify
I just gotta testify
Amazing grace saved my Life

I just wanna testify
Oh amazing grace saved my life
Saved my life, saved my life
I just gotta testify"
Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Inkspots:
Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart
Some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts

Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Ella:
Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much, too much, is fallin' in mine
Into each heart, some tears must fall
But someday- the sun will shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts

Into each life
Some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine

Inkspots:
Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is falling into mine
And into each heart- some tears gotta fall
But, I know, that some day that sun is bound to shine

Together:
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine"
My Own Best Friend,Liza Minnelli,Jazz,"One thing I know
And I've always known
I am my own best friend
Baby's alive
But baby's alone
And baby's her own best friend

Many's the kind
Who told me he cares
But they were scratchin' my back
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs...

And trusting too
That's only for fools
I play the game
When I make the rules
And rule number one
From here to the end
Is I am my own best friend

I am my own best friend

Baby's her own best friend
Three muskateers
Who never said die
Are standing here this minute
Me, myself, and I...

Life is a school
I'll pass every test
If life is a game
I'll play it the best
'Cause I won't give in
And I'll never bend
And I am my own - best - frie-iend..."
The Itch,Belleruche,Jazz,"No I don't think you understand
What I'm looking for, what I yearn for
What I say, who I am and what I stand for
No, no, no

I will not agree, just to keep your peace
Hope you won't agree just to stay with me
It can't be any other way

Even if you
Even if you shift me to the east
Raise me to the north
And drown me in the south
What's left to explore

Don't deny me
I've got your number
I know where you live
Don't refuse me
I know what you need
And just how much to give
Shall I give you what I think you need
Will you let me rack up what I feel
Is good for you, what is good for you
What is good for you

No I'm not asking for
Your undivided twenty four
I need much more than that
Such is the necessity I give more just to receive
But it's the respect I've go to feel
I can't compromise this need
Same as my desire to feel

Even if you
Even if you shift me to the east
Raise me to the north
And drown me in the south
What's left to explore

Don't deny me
I've got your number
I know where you live
Don't refuse me
I know what you need
And just how much to give
Shall I give you what I think you need
Will you let me rack up what I feel
Is good for you, what is good for you
What is good for you

No I don't think you understand
I couldn't talk to you for a week
Out of disappointment and sadness you let me down
And I yearn for you still
Just miss you around

Don't deny me
I've got your number
I know where you live
Don't refuse me
I know what you need
And just how much to give
Shall I give you what I think you need

Angel Eyes,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"Try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Pardon me but I got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Oh, where is my angel eyes

Excuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes, angel eyes"
My man,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore"
My Foolish Heart,Susannah McCorkle,Jazz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart"
The Man I Love,Peggy Lee,Jazz,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best
To make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both
Won't say a word

Maybe
I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure
To meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday
Will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'd never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting
For the man I love"
Americano,The Brian Setzer Orchestra,Jazz,"He's drivin' a jeep
But he ain't in the Army

Never seen a horse

He wanna be Americano
Americano, Americano
He wants to drive a Cadillac
Now he's chasing showgirls
Smokin' Camels, whiskey and soda
Now he's never goin' back

He's cruisin streets for gold

A coca cola Joe
And a pizza pie to go

Gotta buy a diamond ring
'Cause that's his baby's
Favorite thing
Okay, all right, yeah man

Wanna be American

Jump For Joy,Duke Ellington And His Orchestra,Jazz,"Fare thee well land of cotton.
Cotton lisle is out of style,
Honey chile
Jump for Joy
DOn't you grieve little Eve
All the hounds I do believe
Have been killed
Ain't 'cha thrilled?
Jump for Joy
Have you seen pastures groovy?
Green pastures was just a technicolor movie
When you stomp up to heaven and you meet old Saint Pete
Tell that boy
""Jump for joy""
Step right in
Give Pete some skin and
Jump for Joy"
On The Sunny Side Of The Street,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street.

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street.

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over.

If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller.
Gonna set my feet
On the sunny side of the street.

Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street.

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Live can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street.

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over.

If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street."
Don't Smoke In Bed,Nina Simone,Jazz,"I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said
 
Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed
 
Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed"
The Smile Of A Child,Incognito,Jazz,"There's no song like a love song
(Love song)
No love like true love
(True love)
No smile
Like the smile of a child

Be like a child
Welcome each day one at a time
Don't be a afraid
(Do be do do be do)
To say you're sorry when you're wrong
Be a better you
Be like a child



Be like a child
Don't lose yourself in a world of cares
Let yourself go
(Do be do do be do)
Oh, be happy and be loved
Be a better you
Be like a child

Be like a child
Welcome each day...
And, don't lose yourself..."
In The Morning,Norah Jones,Jazz,"I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can't stop myself from falling
Falling back again
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

Dark like the shady corner
Inside a violin
Hot like to burn my lips
I know I can't win
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

I tried to quit you but I'm too weak
Waking up without you
I can hardly speak at all

My girlfriend tried to help me
Get you off my mind
She tried a little tea and sympathy
To help me to unwind
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

Funny how my favorite shirt
Smells like you more than me
Bitter traces left behind
In stains no one can see
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon

You're gonna put me in an early grave
I know I'm your slave whenever you call

I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can stop myself from falling
Falling back again
Falling back again
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon"
Sad Song,Room Eleven,Jazz,"Does it have to be a sad song?
Isn't it a shame?
The ones I try the hardest with
Never stay the same

And I just can't decide if it's good or bad
The times I hold the dearest are the times we never had

We've yet to have

We've yet to have

And isn't it a sad song,
It's some jazz
How perfectly we fit today,
What yesterday we passed

And I just can't consider another in your place
Holding another hand, seeing another face

We've only had

We've only had

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame, oh it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

It is a goodbye song
It is time for the blues
Stomp away through shallow puddles
In your water walking shoes

We only had one exquisite corpse
Over ginger and Pim's,
And the kind of back scratching
That doesn't brake skin

But we will have, oh I know it!
We will have, oh I know it!

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame, oh it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

We will have, I know it!
We will have, oh"
For The Love of You,Candy Dulfer,Jazz,"Hey baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me
Yeah yeah yeah

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
Well, when you're loving me, ooh baby

Love to be, riding the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch
It seems to me, we can sail together
In and out of mystery

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Paradise, I have to think
Can't feel as secure again
You're the key and this I see

Now and then I lose my way
Usin' words to try
And say what I feel

Oh yeah, your love is real
I might as well sign my name on a card
That's been sayin' better

See, time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done
Just about all that I can do

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you"
Elmer's Tune,Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,Jazz,"Why are the stars always winkin'
And blinkin' above?
What makes a fella start thinkin'
Of fallin' in love?

It's not the season
The reason
It's plain as the moon
It's just Elmer's tune

What makes a lady of eighty
Go out on the loose?
Why does a gander meander
In search of a goose?

What puts the kick in
A chicken?
The magic in June?
It's just Elmer's tune

Listen, listen
There's a lot you're liable to be missin'
Sing it, swing it
Any ol' way and any ol' time

The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies
The cop on the beat
The candy maker, the baker
The man on the street

The city charmer
The farmer
The man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies
The cop on the beat
The banker 
And the man on the street

The city charmer
The farmer
The man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

They all sing Elmer's tune
They all sing Elmer's tune"
I've Got a Crush on You,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you"
Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think),Guy Lombardo,Jazz,"You work and work for years and years, you're always on the go
You never take a minute off, too busy makin' dough
Someday you say, you'll have your fun, when you're a millionaire
Imagine all the fun you'll have in your old rockin' chair

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by, as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

You're gonna take that ocean trip, no matter come what may
You've got your reservations made, but you just can't get away
Next year for sure, you'll see the world, you'll really get around
But how far can you travel when you're six feet underground?

Your heart of hearts, your dream of dreams, your ravishing brunette
She's left you and she's now become somebody else's pet
Lay down that gun, don't try my friend to reach the great beyond
You'll have more fun by reaching for a redhead or a blond

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by, as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

You never go to night clubs and you just don't care to dance
You don't have time for silly things like moonlight and romance
You only think of dollar bills tied neatly in a stack
But when you kiss a dollar bill, it doesn't kiss you back

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by, as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think"
I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart,Jane Monheit,Jazz,"There ain't no use in me trying to tell you how I feel
'Cause what I feel ain't what you're feeling
I don't know what we did wrong, I just know if you come home
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again

There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been
'Cause where you've been ain't where I'm going
'Cause if I ask you where you've been the hurting starts and it don't end
So I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, I ain't gonna let you break my heart again

Tears don't become me, pain ain't my friend
It seems like you enjoy my crying, baby
You always said that I was strong, I believe that you were wrong
Lately God knows I have been trying

There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt, baby
'Cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding
If you decide you're coming home when you walk in, it won't be like before
'Cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, oh no, oh no, no, no

Tears don't become me, pain ain't my friend
It seems like you enjoy my crying, baby
You always said that I was strong, I believe that you were wrong
Lately God knows I have been trying

There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt, baby
'Cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding
If you decide you're coming home when you walk in, it won't be like before
'Cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, ain't gonna let you break my heart again, oh no, no"

Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,Lena Horne,Jazz,"Oh listen, sister, I love my Mr. Man
And I can't tell you why there ain't no reason
For me to love dat man
It must be sumthin' dat the angels done plan

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly
I got to love one man till I die
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine

Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine

When he goes away dat's a rainy day
But when he comes back dat day is fine
The sun will shine

He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' dat man of mine"
Learnin' The Blues,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"The tables are empty - the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song - it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning - just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson - in learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light - one after another
Won't help you forget her - and the way that you love her
You're only burning - a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track - for learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you - constantly
When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep - the whole night you're crying
You just can't forget her - soon you even stop trying
You'll walk the floor - and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break - you're learnin' the (those) blues"

Before Too Long,Jazzamor,Jazz,"(Mary applegate, roland grosch, bettina mischke, helfried wildenhain)
(Inverness/Scotland)

One day in spring you flap your wings you fly away
On borrowed time and realize something's on your mind
You wonder when the journey ends
And will you find the way

Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself yourself again

Reflections in a moving train you're far from home
You see the sky just passing by never to return
And in a field it seemed so real
A girl lies all alone

Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself yourself again

You walk and walk, and wonder where
Now is she really there

Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself again
Ooh- before too long
Ooh- you know what's wrong
Ooh - you're running from yourself yourself again"
Scootcha-Booty,Al Jarreau,Jazz,"Number one is the clock track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin' the pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in the distance runnin' darlin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

Stumblers stumblin' they gonna stumble on it
Bumblers bumlin' will bumble 'til they've found it
No more slumberin' get out from under darlin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

I seen some lessons in that new school, so cool
You never laugh or smile or grin
The same expression if they boo you
Now if that ain't the time to laugh you've gotta tell me when

Paint some flowers on your wagon
To help yourself to laugh and grin
Pick up them trousers kid they're saggin'
And don't bite snap when you rap and someone will let you in

Number on is the track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin' the pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Summer's gone in the distance runnin' darlin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move

Computers workin' but I'm starvin'
I'd to show it how to sweat
Before it's over we'll be farmin'
You know that just might be the best thing to happen yet

Number one is the track is runnin' darlin'
Drummer's drummin' the pulse is pumpin' darlin'
Somethin's comin' to get you up and runnin'

Scootcha-booty bottom move
Scootcha-booty bottom move"
Dedicated to You,Kurt Elling,Jazz,"If I should write a book for you
That brought me fame and fortune too
That book would be like my heart, my soul
And me dedicated to you

And if I should paint a picture too
That showed the loveliness and the brilliance of you
My art would be like my heart
And me dedicated to you

To you because your love is the beacon
That lights up my way
To you because with you I know
A lifetime could be just one heavenly day

If I should find one twinkling star
One half as wondrous as you are
That star would be like my heart
And me dedicated, dedicated to you

To you for your love is the beacon of light
That brightens up my day
With you I know I'd live a lifetime of love
In a heavenly way, every heavenly day

For if I should find one lucky star
One half as lucky as you are
That star would be like my heart
And me dedicated to you, all for you

Dedicated to you, all for you and given to you
Dedicated to you"
Laura,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The LAUGH that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura
But she's only a dream"
The Nearness Of You,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft light to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
The nearness of you"
Deeper Than You Think,George Benson,Jazz,Instrumental
Flame,Al Jarreau,Jazz,"So close and yet so smart
Head first before the heart
Ain't no shame
Ain't no game
With the flame

Coldwaters rush in March
No place for April flowers
Take her name
Say she came
With the flame

I've been told
When the stars all align
That even bitter lips like mine
Will call the moon a friend and kiss again
Some I'm told
Let their hearts read the signs
While other men are hungerin
And can't let it in

Be still my foolish heart
Please don't upset the cart
Stay the same
Ain't no game
With the flame

I've been told
I'll be dancin in time
Walkin' rhythm talkin' rhyme
The earth will turn and send the sun again
All my gold
For a light or a sign
Some kind of kin
To say my friend
Let it out - let it in

Strange fire down below
So 'fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame

Strange fire down below
So fraid to let you know
Change my name
Start again
With the flame
The flame (2x)"
Prelude To A Kiss,Duke Ellington,Jazz,"If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss
If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony -
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh! How my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss.
If you hear a song in blue

Laughing At Life,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
Smile through your tears, laughing at liife
No road is lonely, if you will only
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Smile through your tears, laugh at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life"
Stormy Weather,Lena Horne,Jazz,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky,
Stormy weather,
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time.

Life is bare,
Gloom and misery everywhere,
Stormy weather,
Just can't get my poor self together,
I'm weary all the time, the time.
So weary all the time.

When he went away, the blues walked in and met me,
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me,
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more.

Can't go on,
All I have in life is gone,
Stormy weather,
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time.
Keeps rainin' all the time.

I walk around, heavy-hearted and sad,
Night comes around, I'm still feelin' bad,
Rain pourin' down, blindin' every hope I had,
This pitterin', patterin', beatin' and spatterin' drives me mad!
Love, love, love, love!
This misery is just too much for me!

Can't go on,
Everything I had is gone,
Stormy weather,
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time,
Keeps rainin' all the time."
Jim,Sarah Vaughan,Jazz,"Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get feelin' low
I say let's call it quits
Then I hang on and let him go 
Breakin' my heart in bits

Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me
But even if he does you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim

I'll go on lovin' my Jim"
Jeepers Creepers,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get them peepers?
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh oh, git up
How'd they get so lit up?
Gosh oh, gee oh
How'd they get that size?

Golly gee
When you turn them heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers, creepers
Where'd ya get them peepers
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize

How they hypnotize
Where did your get those

Where did your get them there eyes?"
Without Your Love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"Without your love
I'm like a song without words
Just like a nest without birds
Without your love
Fine sun above
Will never shine at my door
My life holds nothing in store
Without your love
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

I've rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love"
Daylight Is Short In Fall,Rebekka Bakken,Jazz,"Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, ""Baby can't you see?""
""Baby understand?""
""Baby you're for me""
""Oh won't you take my hand?""
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Man I held so tight
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time
Baby, baby all the time"
Hallelujah,Chris Botti,Jazz,Instrumental
Alone Together,Chet Baker,Jazz,"Can't stand your present job, afraid of getting fired
Depressed? Staring at the0late night tube
You could call that number
But you'd just get someone just like you

Well, I feel that way too
Just the same as you
Like it's getting worse before it's getting better
I've got troubles of my own
But as long as you're alone
Stick with me and we'll be alone""together

Beer is warm, dinner's cold and greasy
Even when life isn't hard it always seems uneasy
All alone, nobody""seems to care
Everybody's got some place
And you don't fit in anywhere

You wonder, will you always have to live in doubt
Sometimes you feel just
Like Hank Williams used to sing about
Through the window, the night's so still
And if you listen you can hear
That lonesome whippoorwill

Can't stand your present job, afraid of getting fired
Depressed? Staring at the0late night tube"
I Got It Bad,Stacey Kent,Jazz,"The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The good book says ""go seek and ye shall find""
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;
In emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him.

Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him, nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!"
I'll Chase The Blues Away,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"I'll chase the blues away
I'll laugh and sing all day
I've found my lover, someone who'll be true

The blue birds in a tree
Will sing their song to me
For they'll discover I'm no longer blue

I've travelled far
In search of someone like you
For what you are
Is the dream that I've prayed would soon come true

I'll chase the blues away
I'll print some news today
I've found my lover, someone who'll be true"
Send One Your Love,Boney James,Jazz,"Send her your love with a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it with a flower from your heart
Show him your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's straight from your heart

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
Waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion

Send her your love with a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it with a flower from your heart
Show him your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's straight from the heart

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory

Send one your love, don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason when it's coming from your heart, whoa whoa
From your heart, whoa whoa, from your heart, whoa whoa

Send one your love, show him your love
Send one your love, your love"
The Real Thing,Bebel Gilberto,Jazz,"Looking forward to seeing you
My, it's been such a long, long time
Looking forward to feeling you
Love has been so heavy on my mind
On my mind, all the time
On my mind

Had a chance to look forward
To be part of your love in my dreams
But I can't be happy with
Fantasizing instead of the real thing
The real thing, not my dreams
The real thing

There are no words
That can express the way
I feel today
'Cause I feel today
Like no other day
Longing more and more
For your loving

There are no songs
That I can sing
To ease my troubled mind
'Cause my troubled mind
Will be a troubled blue
Until you say
You're coming home to me

So let me hear you sweet baby
Let me hear you say the words
Send your love in a hurry
Send it's melody by a love bird
A love bird, send your word
By a love bird

There are no words
That can express the way
I feel today
'Cause I feel today
Like no other day
Longing more and more
For your loving

There is no other someone
That can ease my achin' heart
'Cause my achin' heart
Told my troubled mind
The only remedy to its pain
Is your love

Let me hear you say, baby
Everything's gonna be all right
Stop my heart from achin'
Stop my eyes from cryin'
Through the night
Through the night, I won't cry
Through the night"
In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning,Johnny Hartman,Jazz,"In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never even think of counting sheep

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most

When the sun is high in the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on
Something happens to you

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
That's the time you miss her most of all"
The Night We Called It A Day,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day
Soft through the dark


The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than i
The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day"
Bell Bottom Trousers,Guy Lombardo,Jazz,"Once there was a little girl who lived next to me
And she loved a sailor boy, he was only three
Now he's on a battleship in his sailor suit
Just a great big sailor but she thinks he's very cute

With his bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
She loves her sailor and he loves her too

When her sailor boy's away on the ocean blue
Soldier boys all flirt with her but to him she's true
Though they smile and tip their caps and they wink their eyes
She just smiles and shakes her head, then she softly sighs

Oh, bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
She loves her sailor and he loves her too

When her sailor went to sea to see what he could see
She saw that he ate spinach, now he's big as he can be
When he's home they stroll along, they don't give a hoot
She won't let go of his hand, even to salute

If her sailor she can't find on the bounding main
She is hopeful he will soon come home safe again
So they can get married and raise a family
Dress up all their kiddies in sailor's dungarees

Oh, bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
She loves her sailor and he loves her too"
Yours,Sara Gazarek,Jazz,"You push,
You shove
You do all that you can
And time, it slips away
Everything will keep it some place
And all that I say

When the distance
Keeps us distant.
You know I'll always think about you
Even when I'm
Not all there
The love I have is yours.
Baby it's yours

You sit
You wait
You do all you can
And life, it fades away
But don't forget
The soul that you have
And all that we say

Dark days come and
Bright ones go out
But you will always make it better
People see it
And I feel it
The love I have, baby it's yours
It's yours

Forget the things that people say to try to hurt you
Forget their fears that overtake them in their lives
Forget this world with all it's petty disappointments
But don't forget that your the lovely person I love so.

Dark days come in
Bright ones go out
But you will always make it better
People see it
And I feel it
The love I have is yours.
It's yours.

Ooh..."
Christmas Is Coming,Vince Guaraldi Trio,Jazz,Instrumental
Eternity,Lizz Wright,Jazz,"Something about you really moves me
You found the waterfalls, the treasures in me
What is the gift that you possess?
What is this strange happiness?
I will find the answer
And if the answer is you
My love
I'll have to have you
For eternity
I'll have to have you

Something in your voice
Something in your eyes
I don't feel so lost
And I don't have to hide
Something has set me free
And I don't mind
That I can't explain
I just choose to believe
That you have something to do with it

And I'll find the answer
And if the answer is you
My love
I'll have to have you
For eternity
I'll have to have you
I'll have to have you
For eternity
I'll have to have you"
I'm Just a Lucky So and So,Ella Fitzgerald,Jazz,"As I walk down the street
Seems everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

The birds in every tree
Are all so neighborly
They sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

If you should ask me the amount
In my bank account
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
But that don't worry me, confidentially
I've got a dream that's a pippin'

And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so"
There Is No Greater Love,Billie Holiday,Jazz,"There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than that you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you"
When I'm Called Home,Abbey Lincoln,Jazz,"When I'm called home
I will bring a book
That tells of strange and funny turns
And of the heart it took
To keep on living in a world
That never was my own
A world of haunted memories
Of other worlds unknown.
I'll tell them of the trouble here
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will sing a song
And tell them of a beggar's life
Where everything goes wrong
Where everybody's hopes and dreams
Are shattering by the wind.

I'll tell them of a ghostly world
Of us and they and him.
I'll tell them how the shadows fall
When they call me home.
When I'm called home
I will tell the stars
Of the battles that were lost
In a world of wars.
I will tell the rivers
Of the children lost at sea
Of a how a soul is bartered
And what it costs a spirit free.
Hallelujah tell a story, oh,
When they call me home."
Beat Me Daddy_ Eight To The Bar,The Andrews Sisters,Jazz,"Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
He can play piano any way that you like it 
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar 
When he plays, it's a ball 
He's the daddy of them all 

The people gather around when he gets on the stand 
Then when he plays, he gets a hand 
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there bothers to dance 
But when he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank 
A-plunkin' on the keys 
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff 
A-riffin' out with ease 
And when he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar 
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano 
And we all know 
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance 
The cats all holler ""Hooray"" 
You'll hear them say, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
When he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler, ""Beat me up Daddy, beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

The people gather around when he gets up on the stand 
Then when he plays, he gets a hand 
The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there ever bothers to dance 
But when he plays with the bass and guitar 
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"" 

A-plink plink, a-plank plank, a-plink plank, plink plank 
A-plunkin' on the keys

Get Out Of Town,Patricia Barber,Jazz,"Get out of town before it's too late my love
Get out of town be good to me please
Why wish me harm? Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm the birds off the trees?

Just disappear, I care for you much too much
And when you're near close to me dear we touch too much
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That darling it's getting me down, so on your mark get set get out of town

Just disappear, I care for you much too much
And when you're near close to me dear we touch too much
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That darling it's getting me down, so on your mark get set get out of town"
Hello Dolly,Louis Armstrong,Jazz,"Hello Dolly!
This is Louis, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favorite songs from way back when

So take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Hello, Dolly!
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when

So golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Fellas, she'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again"
Truth & Lies,Us3,Jazz,"A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
But I can't find the words that properly describes
The problems that arise

So I gotta decide to either
Keep it bottled inside or swallow my pride
But I got God on my side I'm a follow his guide
So I got down on my knees, apologized

For all the times my son looked in his fathers eyes
And saw the lies and alibis
Next day to my surprise when I woke at sunrise
I saw my son rise right next to me

Put his hands on my head and said to me
In a voice best described as heavenly
The truth shall set you free
Stop letting me walk around with blindness on

I'm relying on you to teach me right from wrong
'Cause one day I'll be gone, won't be a child for long
You've found your words, now go write your song

Who, what, when, where, why?
How do I find which way to reply?
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
Surprise, the truth's right in front of your eyes

Riddle me this
You see a man slitting his wrists
And he's rich
Beautiful women wanna give him a kiss

He was given a gift but it wasn't something he wished
He'd rather throw it all away for some ignorant bliss
To exist or not to exist? That's a question I try to resist
Deep like a bottomless pit

So I swallow my pride and follow my wits
My motto is this, hold your head high
You could call it a risk
But if I can't live on my feet I'll die on my knees

Sowing the seeds of the struggle
I gotta be free or better yet I gotta be me
I gotta believe that if the truth is a lie
Then knowledge is key

So yo, gimme the question and let me dissect it
My questions are deeper than my jealousy's best diss
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind
I gotta find what I seek or I'll never respond

Who, what, when, where, why?
How do I find which way to reply?
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
Surprise, the truth's right in front of your eyes

We've been lied to, we got reparations due
While you're at it, where's our 40 acres too?
Save the mule? In fact you can save the bull
Why should we believe anything you say is true?

Been waiting too long man, them days are through
We no longer cater to red, white and blue
I posed those same questions to you-know-who
He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you""

I said well when exactly you gonna do for us too
And where will we be when it finally comes through
Forget it, I don't know why I'm asking you
You stole our ballots too we know how you do

The proud and few, we never ever doubted you
Until we found out how your accountants
Grew fat from laying us flat, taking the rap obeying your crap
Seeing the real reason that we're breaking our backs

And yo, we wanna know why the leaders are gone
People can die, corporations treat us as pawns
You can see that it's wrong but you let them lead us along
They're the same corporations that you need to be strong

And I know that it's a game, truth is I shoulder the blame
I'm just another con artist making a claim
I know I need more than my words working for change
It makes me frustrated that I'm seeking personal gain but tell me

Who, what, when, where, why?
How do I find which way to reply?
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
Surprise, the truth's right in front of your eyes"
My Baby Just Cares For Me,Tony Bennett,Jazz,"My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for furs and laces
My baby don't care for high toned places

My baby don't care for rings
Or other expensive things
She is sensible as can be

My baby don't care, who knows it
My baby just cares for me

My baby's no Brando fan
Rock Hudson is not her man
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for Tyrone Power
She'd rather be with me by the hour

Jeff Chandler is not her style
And Liberace smile
Is something she just can't see

I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
She answers my prayers for
My baby just cares for little old me

At least that's what she tells me anyway"
A Lover Is Blue,Frank Sinatra,Jazz,"Yesterday we were gay,
I was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow,
You've gone, and so a lover is blue
Life was sweet, so complete,
Now I've suddenly waken to find I'm forsaken,
Alone, and so a lover is blue
Do you still remember our love affair,
Does it matter to you,
But I'll have to go through our door to care
Here and there everywhere,
Every scene just reminds me
Of something that binds me
To you, and so a lover is blue"
Lost Without U,Marcus Miller,Jazz,"I'm lost without u

The Shadow Of Your Smile,Astrud Gilberto,Jazz,"The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love, and see
All the lovely things
You are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now, when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile"
